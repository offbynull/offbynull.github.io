<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

Attaching a new limb to an existing leaf node is never possible because...

1. it'll turn that existing leaf node to an internal node, which doesn't make sense because in the context of phylogenetic trees leaf nodes identify known organisms
2. it will cease to be a simple tree -- simple trees can't have nodes of degree_GRAPH 2 (train of edges not allowed).
