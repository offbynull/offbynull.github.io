<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">

<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

This is code I came up with to solve the ch 6 final assignment in the Pevzner book. I came up with / fleshed out the ideas myself -- the book only hinted at specific bits. I believe the fundamentals are correct but the implementation is finicky and requires a lot of knob twisting to get decent results.
