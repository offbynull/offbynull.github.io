<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

The logic described above is very reminiscent of the algorithm for finding a leaf node's limb length from just the distance matrix. The formula is = if A and B are within the different subtrees, but > if the same.

When writing notes in the algorithm section, break this out into a "subtree detection" algorithm that'll tell you if 2 nodes are in the same subtree vs different subtrees.
