This term may also be used in reference to homopolymer errors, known to happen with nanopore technology. From [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25459670)...

> A homopolymer is when you have stretches of the same nucleotide, and the error is miscounting the number of them. e.g: GAAAC could be called as "GAAC" or "GAAAAC" or even "GAAAAAAAC".
