<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

The alphabet above was pulled from the Pevzner book section 2.16: Complications in Motif Finding. It's a subset of the IUPAC nucleotide codes alphabet. The author didn't mention if the alphabet was explicitly chosen for regulatory motif finding. If it was, it may have been derived from running probabilities over already discovered regulatory motifs: e.g. for the motifs already discovered, if a position has 2 possible nucleotides then G/C (S), G/T (K), C/T (Y), and A/T (W) are likely but other combinations aren't.
