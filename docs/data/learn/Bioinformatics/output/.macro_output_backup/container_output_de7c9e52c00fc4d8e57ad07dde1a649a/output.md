<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">

<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

What purpose does this actually serve? Mimicking 1 long read-pair as n shorter read-pairs isn't equivalent to actually having sequenced those n shorter read-pairs. For example, what if the longer read-pair being broken up has an error? That error replicates when breaking into n shorter read-pairs, which gives a false sense of having good coverage_SEQ and makes it seem as if it wasn't an error.
