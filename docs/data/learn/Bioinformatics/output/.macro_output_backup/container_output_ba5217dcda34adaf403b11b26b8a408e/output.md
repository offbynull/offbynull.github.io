Confused about what's happening above? Think about it like this...

* mean([0+0.5, 0+1, 0+0.25]) = 0.833
* mean([1+0.5, 1+1, 1+0.25]) = 1.833
* mean([2+0.5, 2+1, 2+0.25]) = 2.833
* mean([3+0.5, 3+1, 3+0.25]) = 3.833
* ...

If you're including some constant amount for each element in the averaging, the result of the average will include that constant amount. In the case above, `{kt} \frac{D_{l1,l2}}{2}` is a     constant being added at each element of the average.
