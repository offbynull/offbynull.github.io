<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

The above matrix was supplied by the Pevzner book. You can find it online [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Class/FieldGuide/BLOSUM62.txt), but the indel scores on that website are set to -4 where as in the Pevzner book I've seen them set to -5. I don't know which is correct. I don't know if BLOSUM62 defines a constant for indels.
