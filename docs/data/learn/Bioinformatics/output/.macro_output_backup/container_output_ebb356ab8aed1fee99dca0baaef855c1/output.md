<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

Later on the book goes on to say explicitly say that the simple tree won't have any internal edges of weight 0. I'd already implied as much given that they'd be the same organism at both ends, and this algorithm explicitly won't allow it in that if it walks up to a node, it'll branch off that node (an additional edge weight of 0 won't extend past that node).
