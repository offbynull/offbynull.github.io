<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

The Pevzner book says that bubble removal is a common feature in modern assemblers. My assumption is that, before pulling out contigs (described later on), basic probabilities are used to try and suss out if a branch in a bubble / prefix fork / suffix fork is bad and remove it if it is. This (hopefully) results in longer contigs.
