<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

Why is it greater than OR equal? I suppose it has to do with edges having a weight of 0. So for example, in the example graph above, if the edge (i1, i2) had a weight of 0 then the RHS and LHS would be equal.

But, does it make sense to have 0 weight edges? If an edge has a 0 weight, why is it ever there? Doesn't it mean that species represented by both sides of the edge are exactly the same (0 distance)? The book says >= so that's what I'm going with.
