<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

To clarify: An additive distance matrix may have been generated from one of many non-simple trees. However, when reconstructing a phylogenetic tree from the additive distance matrix, if you restrict yourself to a simple tree you'll only ever have 1 tree to reconstruct to. This makes the algorithms simpler.

Also, additive distance matrices are mentioned above, but algorithms exist for both additive distance matrices and non-additive distance matrices -- non-additive distance matrices get approximated to simple trees.
