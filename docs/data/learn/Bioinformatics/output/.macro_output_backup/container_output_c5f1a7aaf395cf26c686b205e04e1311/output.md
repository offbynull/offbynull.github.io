<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">

<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

Notice that with v3 removed from the additive distance matrix, path(i0, v2) merges into a single edge. Recall that ...

 * phylogenetic trees are simple trees: a simple tree can't have a node with degree_GRAPH 2 (a train of non-branching edges is not allowed)
 * for any additive distance matrix, there exists a unique simple tree that fits that matrix

The trimmed version of the tree fits the trimmed version of the distance matrix.
