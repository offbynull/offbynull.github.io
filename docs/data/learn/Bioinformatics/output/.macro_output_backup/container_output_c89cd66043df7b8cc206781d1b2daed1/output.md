<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

The book is inconsistent about whether simple trees can have internal edges of weight 0. Early in the book it says that it can and later on it says that it goes back on that and says internal edges of weight 0 aren't actually allowed. I'd already implied as much given that they'd be the same organism at both ends, and this algorithm explicitly won't allow it in that if it walks up to a node, it'll branch off that node (an additional edge weight of 0 won't extend past that node).
