<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

The Pevzner book challenged you to come up with a greedy algorithm for multiple alignment using profile matrices. This is what I was able to come up with. I have no idea if my logic is correct / optimal, but with toy sequences that are highly related it seems to perform well. 

UPDATE: This algorithm seems to work well for the final assignment. ~380 a-domain sequences were aligned in about 2 days and it produced an okay/good looking alignment. Aligning those sequences using normal multiple alignment would be impossible -- nowhere near enough memory or speed available.
