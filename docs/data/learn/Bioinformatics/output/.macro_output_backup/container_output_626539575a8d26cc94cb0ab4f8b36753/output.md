The multiple alignment algorithm displayed above was specifically for on global alignment on a graph implementation, but it should be obvious how to apply it to most of the other alignment types (e.g. local alignment). With a little bit of effort it can also be converted to using the divide-and-conquer algorithm discussed earlier (there aren't that many leaps in logic).
