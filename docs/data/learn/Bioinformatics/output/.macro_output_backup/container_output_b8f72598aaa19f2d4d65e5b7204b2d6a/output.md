<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

What purpose does this actually serve? Mimicking 1 long read_SEQ as n shorter read_SEQs isn't equivalent to actually having sequenced those n shorter read_SEQs. For example, what if the longer read_SEQ being broken up has an error? That error replicates when breaking into n shorter read_SEQs, which gives a false sense of having good coverage_SEQ and makes it seem as if it wasn't an error.
