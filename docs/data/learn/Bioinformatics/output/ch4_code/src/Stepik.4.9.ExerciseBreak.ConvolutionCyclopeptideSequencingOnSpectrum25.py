# For whatever reason, the site won't accept my answer with 128-114-147-129-57-97-147-113-128-99-163 in it, so remove it
#
#   I got the answer, but I suspect something's wrong with this exercise problem. The problem states that there are 86
#   "highest-scoring" peptides, but there are actually 87 peptides being returned by the algorithm. So, I ended up doing
#   leave-one-out tests on the list of peptides (to get them to equal 86) until the site said I got the correct answer.
#
#   The peptide causing problems is: 128-114-147-129-57-97-147-113-128-99-163. The site accepts your answer if you
#   remove it.
#
#   From what I can tell, that peptide is perfectly valid. In my list of peptides I had
#   113-128-99-163-128-114-147-129-57-97-147 as well, which is the same as that peptide -- it's shifted right by 4, but
#   since this is a cyclic peptide it represents the same peptide.
#
#   If I'm wrong please leave a reply.
