# Exercise Break: Prove that the number of iterations of the Lloyd algorithm does not exceed the number of partitions of
# the data set into k clusters.

# MY ANSWER
# ---------
# I have no idea how to answer this, or what it's even asking. I think it's asking to prove that the Llyod algorithm
# can't exceed the number of different ways a set of points can be partitioned into k clusters?
#
# The number of ways to partition was figured out in Stepik.8.4.ExerciseBreak.CountDifferentWaysToPartition.py
#
# Assuming each cluster has to have at least 1 point, if I have 5 points and k=2: 2^(len - 1) - 1 = 15
#
# How can I prove that it won't go past 15 iterations? I don't know. This is supposed to build on previous exercise
# breaks, but I was never able to "prove" those either.
