There are no code challenges for anything for the sections of the chapter related to soft clustering (8.10, 8.11, 8.12,
and 8.13) but it takes up a huge portion of the chapter. Whoever wrote it tried there best to explain things, but it
still comes off as obtuse. This package is a scratch region where I'm going to try to implement / try-out things
discussed in the chapter.
