# Where does the 27x20 come from? There are 27 nodes in total in the state transition graph of the book. There are 20
# amino acids in total.

# Emissions for the source node (S) and sink node (E) are omitted, because they can't emit anything (all 0 emission
# probabilities). If you add them in (20 each), you'll get exactly 27*20=540 emission probabilities, which is what the
# quesiton is asking for.
