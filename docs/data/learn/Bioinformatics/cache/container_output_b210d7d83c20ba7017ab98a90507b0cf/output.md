The question remains, if you were to actually do this (re-formulate an alignment graph as an HMM), how would you go about choosing the hidden state transition probabilities? That remains unclear at the moment. The probabilities in the example below were handpicked to force the optimal hidden path to be the one highlighted.

This section isn't meant to be a solution to some practical problem. It's just a building block for another concept discussed further on. As long as you understand that what's being shown here is a thing that can happen, you're good to move forward.
