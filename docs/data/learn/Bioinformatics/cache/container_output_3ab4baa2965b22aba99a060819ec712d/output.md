<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

It's unclear if there's an analog for this for non-binary trees (variable number of children per node). Maybe if the children have a specific order, it recursively visits the first half (left children), then visits the parent node, then recursively visits the last half (right children). But, how would this work if there were an odd number of children? The middle child wouldn't be in the left-half or right-half.
