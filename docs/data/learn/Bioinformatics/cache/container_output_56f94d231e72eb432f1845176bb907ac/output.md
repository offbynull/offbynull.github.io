<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">

<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

The terminology I used below is mildly confusing.

 * Symbol: A unique element within the sequence (e.g. "banana¶" is made up of the *unique elements* / *symbols* {a, b, n, ¶}).
 * Symbol instance: The occurrence of a symbol (e.g. index 4 of "banana¶" is the 2nd *occurrence* / *symbol instance* of *n*).
 * Symbol instance count: The occurrence number of a symbol instance (e.g. index 4 of "banana¶" is *n* and it *is occurrence number* / *has a symbol instance count of* 2).
</div>
