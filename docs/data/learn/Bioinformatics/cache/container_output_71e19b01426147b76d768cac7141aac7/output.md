Still confused? Scaling makes sense if you think of it in terms of angles. The vectors (5,5) vs (10,10) have the same angle. Any vector with the same angle is just a scaled version of the other -- each of its components are scaled by the same constant...

* (10,10) is (5,5) with each component scaled by 2.0x
* (5,5) is (10,10) with each component scaled by 0.5x

                              "(10,10)"
                               .'
                             .'
                           .'
                         .'
      "(5,5)"          .'
      .'             .' 
    .'             .'

.' 45          .'  45
