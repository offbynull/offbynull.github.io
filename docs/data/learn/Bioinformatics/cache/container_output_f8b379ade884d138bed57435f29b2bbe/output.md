<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

If you're trying to determine if the the components of the gene expression vectors follow the same pattern regardless of scale, the lack of shift support seems to make this unusable. The gene expression vectors may follow a similarly scaled patterns but it seems likely that each pattern is at an arbitrary offset (shift). So then what's the point of this? Why did the book mention if for gene expression analysis?

Pearson similarity seems to factor in both scaling and shifting. Use that instead.
