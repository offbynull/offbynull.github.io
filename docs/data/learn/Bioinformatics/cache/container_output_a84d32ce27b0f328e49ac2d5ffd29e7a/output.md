<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

Much like cosine similarity, I can't pinpoint exactly what it is that the formula is calculating / the reasoning behind the calculations. The only part I somewhat understand is where it's getting the euclidean distance to the average of each vector.

The rest of it I don't understand.
