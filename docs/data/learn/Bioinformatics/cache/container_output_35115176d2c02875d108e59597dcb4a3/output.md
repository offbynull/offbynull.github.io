<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

Given a profile HMM, you can probably build a consensus string for it using the most probable emitted sequence algorithm (Algorithms/Discriminator Hidden Markov Models/Most Probable Emitted Sequence_TOPIC). If I recall correctly, I !!tried!! to modify the algorithm to work with hidden states, so it should work with profile HMMs.
