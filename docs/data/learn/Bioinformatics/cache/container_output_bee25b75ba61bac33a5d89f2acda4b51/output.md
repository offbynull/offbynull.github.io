<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

In the HMM above, each emitting hidden state has a 100% symbol emission probability for emitting the symbol at the sequence index that it's for vs a 0% probability of embedding all other symbols. For example, I10 has a 100% probability of emitting symbol h. Because of this, the HMM diagram above embeds the sole symbol emission for each emitting hidden state directly in the node vs drawing out dashed edges to dashed symbol emission nodes.
