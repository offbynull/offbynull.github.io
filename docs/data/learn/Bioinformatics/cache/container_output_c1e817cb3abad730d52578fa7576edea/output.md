<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

What is the formula actually calculating / what's the reasoning behind the formula? The only part I understand is the magnitude calculation, which is just the euclidean distance between the origin and the coordinates of a vector. For example, the magnitude between (0,0) and (5,7) is calculated as sqrt((5-0)^2 + (7-0)^2). Since the components of the origin are all always going to be 0, it can be shortened to sqrt(5^2 + 7^2).

The rest of it I don't understand. What is the dot product actually calculating? And why multiply the magnitudes and divide? How does that result in the cosine of the angle?
