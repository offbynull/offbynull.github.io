<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">

<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

Other uses such as longest repeating substring, longest shared substring, shortest non-shared substring, etc.. that are applicable to suffix trees don't look like they're applicable to suffix arrays. I think you need to actually walk the tree for stuff like that.
