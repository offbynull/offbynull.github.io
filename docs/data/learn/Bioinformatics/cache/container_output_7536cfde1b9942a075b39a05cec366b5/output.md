Building and searching trie using the following settings...

```
{
  trie_sequences: ['anana', 'banana', 'ankle'],
  test_sequence: 'banana ankle baxana orange banxxa vehicle',
  end_marker: ¶,
  pad_marker: _,
  max_mismatch: 2
}

```


The following trie was produced ...

```{dot}
digraph G {
 rankdir=LR
 node[fontname="Courier-Bold", fontsize=10, shape=point]
 edge[fontname="Courier-Bold", fontsize=10]
N0 [label=""]
N1 [label=""]
N2 [label=""]
N3 [label=""]
N4 [label=""]
N5 [label=""]
N6 [label=""]
N7 [label=""]
N0 -> N1 [label="e¶"]
N0 -> N3 [label="a"]
N3 -> N2 [label="¶"]
N3 -> N4 [label="n¶"]
N0 -> N5 [label="kl¶"]
N0 -> N6 [label="ba¶"]
N0 -> N7 [label="na¶"]
}
```
