<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

Note what this algorithm is doing. The Pevzner book claims that it's very similar to Llyod's algorithm for k-means clustering in that it's starting off at some random point and pushing that point around to maximize some metric (generic name for this is called [Expectation-maximization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation%E2%80%93maximization_algorithm)).

Monte carlo algorithms like this are typically executed many times, where the best performing execution is the one that gets chosen.
