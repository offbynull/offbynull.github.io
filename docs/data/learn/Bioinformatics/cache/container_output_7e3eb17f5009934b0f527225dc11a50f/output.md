<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">

<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

Confused about what's happening above? Think about it like this...

(9-1)+(8-2)+(7-3) = 9+8+7-1-2-3 = 24+(-6) = 24-6 = sum([9,8,7])-sum([1,2,3])

It's just re-ordering the operations so that it can be represented as two sums. It's perfectly valid.
