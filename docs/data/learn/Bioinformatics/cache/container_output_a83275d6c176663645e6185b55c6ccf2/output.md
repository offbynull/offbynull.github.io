<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

The above matrix was supplied by the Pevzner book. You can find it online [here](https://swift.cmbi.umcn.nl/teach/aainfo/pam250.shtml), but the indel scores on that website are set to -8 Whereas in the Pevzner book I've also seen them set to -5. I don't know which is correct. I don't know if PAM250 defines a constant for indels.
