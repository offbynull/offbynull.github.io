<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

The example machine above is a bad example to model as an HMM. Only two states and emitting a single nucleotide will result in a useless HMM model. The machine should be modeled as emitting 5-mers or something and would likely need more than 2 states?

The example below might be better.
