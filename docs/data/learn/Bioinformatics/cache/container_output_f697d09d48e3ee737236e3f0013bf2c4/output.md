<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

This is essentially a hammer, ignoring much of the logic and techniques derived in prior sections. There is no code for this section because writing it involves doing things like writing a generic linear systems solver, evolutionary algorithms framework, etc... There are Python packages you can use if you really want to do this, but this section is more describing the overarching idea.

The logic and techniques in prior sections typically work much better and much faster than doing something like this, but this doesn't require as much reasoning / thinking. This idea was first hinted at in the Pevzner book when first describing how to assign weights for non-additive distance matrices.
