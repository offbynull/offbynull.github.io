<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

Where might indels come from? The Pevzner book mentions that ...

1. even across individuals within the same population, some parts of a genome may be highly variable (e.g. major histocompatibility complex, a region of human DNA linked to the immune system), meaning indels for those areas may be natural.
2. even across individuals within the same population, genome rearrangements may be normal, meaning that large indel regions may show up when an individual is aligned against its reference genome (reference genome captures just a single genome rearrangement variation -- efforts are being made to work around this, see pan-genome).
3. a reference genome may be incomplete due the limitations of sequencing technology (e.g. multiple large contigs instead of the whole genome), meaning that a correct mapping may not exist for a specific part of the individual organism's sequenced DNA, meaning it ends up mapping to the wrong part of the reference genome and producing indels.
