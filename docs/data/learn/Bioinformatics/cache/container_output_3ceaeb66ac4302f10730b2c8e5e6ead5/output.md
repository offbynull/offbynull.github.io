<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

The best way to move forward with this, assuming that you're brand new to it, is to first understand the following four sub-sections...

* Algorithms/Distance Phylogeny/Tree to Additive Distance Matrix_TOPIC
* Algorithms/Distance Phylogeny/Tree to Simple Tree_TOPIC
* Algorithms/Distance Phylogeny/Additive Distance Matrix Cardinality_TOPIC

Then jump to the algorithm you want to learn (subsection) within Algorithms/Distance Phylogeny/Distance Matrix to Tree_TOPIC and work from the prerequisites to the algorithm. Otherwise all the sections in between comes off as disjointed because it's building the intermediate knowledge required for the final algorithms.
