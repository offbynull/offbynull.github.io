<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">

<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

As a further optimization, rather than assigning each edge to a substring, assign it the position range of that substring within the larger string (start index and end index / start index and length). There may be more than 1 position range for each edge -- either store all of them or just store one (e.g. the one closest to the beginning of the string).
