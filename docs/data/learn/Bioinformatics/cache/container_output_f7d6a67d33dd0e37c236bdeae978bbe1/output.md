The Pevzner book explicitly calls out Lloyd's algorithm for this, but I'm thinking this is more to do with the scoring function for k-means (what's trying to be minimized)? I think the same problem applies to the scoring function for k-centers and the furthest first traveled heuristic?

The examples below are taken directly from the Pevzner book.
