<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

Recall that, in the sequence alignment HMM, each node is a hidden state and each edge is a hidden state transition. This section is telling you how to define hidden state emission probabilities. Recall that a symbol emission happens *after* a transition (emits from the hidden state at the destination of the transition), so this section is tracking emissions by the destination of the edge.
