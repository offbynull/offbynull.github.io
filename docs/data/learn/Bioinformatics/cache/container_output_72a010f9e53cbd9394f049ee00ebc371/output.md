<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

There's some ambiguity here as to what actually happens. Different sources are saying different things. One source says that HSPs keep expanding only if the score doesn't decrease. Other sources are saying HSPs keep expanding as long as they stay above some threshold. I ignored the Pevzner book's description of how BLAST works because it was short, confusing, didn't really explain anything, and glossed over / papered over important details.

The [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAST_(biotechnology)) says that BLAST also uses some statistical analysis to determine if an HSP is significant enough to include. It also says that newer versions of BLAST will combine HSPs into one if the they're close enough together (only a short gap between them). I don't know enough to dig into these parts.
