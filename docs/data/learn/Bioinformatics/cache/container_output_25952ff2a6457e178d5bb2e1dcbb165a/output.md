What's the point of this? If you look at the path and a transition to an E hidden state is coming from a hidden state that's directly to the left (e.g. D10 → E11) vs diagonal (e.g. S → E11), couldn't you just automatically tell if it's an insertion vs match?

This is the way the Pevzner book is doing it, so that's what I'm going to stick to.
