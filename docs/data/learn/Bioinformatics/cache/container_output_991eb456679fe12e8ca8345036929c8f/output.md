<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

The book is inconsistent about whether simple trees can have internal edges of weight 0. Early in the book it says that it can and later on it says that it goes back on that and says internal edges of weight 0 aren't actually allowed. I'd already implied as much given that they'd be the same organism at both ends, but I'm unsure if this algorithm will allow it if fed in a non-additive distance matrix. It should never happend with an additive distance matrix.
