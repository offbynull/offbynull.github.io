<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

This section may seem useless, but it sets the foundation for a different type of HMM discussed later on: profile HMMs. Also, it may be useful for discriminator HMMs as these non-emitting hidden states seem to kinda resemble nodes in a feed-forward neural network? Maybe they could potentially build out higher-order logic chains (e.g. AND, OR, NOT, etc..)?

I may be wrong about this.
