<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

In addition to small parsimony, there's large parsimony.

Small parsimony: When a tree structure and its leaf node sequences are given, derive the internal node sequences with the lowest possible distance (most parsimonious).

Large parsimony: When only the leaf node sequences are given, derive the combination of tree structure and internal node sequences with the lowest possible distance (most parsimonious).

Trying to do large parsimony explodes the search space (e.g. NP-complete), meaning it isn't realistic to attempt.
