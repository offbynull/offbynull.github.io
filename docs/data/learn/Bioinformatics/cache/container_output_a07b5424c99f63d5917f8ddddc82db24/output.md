The meat of this section is the forward-backward full algorithm. The Pevzner book didn't discuss why this algorithm works, but I've done my best to try to reason about it and extend the reasoning to non-emitting hidden states. However, I don't know if my reasoning is correct. It seems to be correct for some cases, but there are many cases I haven't tested for. In any event, I think what's here will work just fine so long as you don't have non-emitting hidden states (and may work if you do have non-emitting hidden states).
