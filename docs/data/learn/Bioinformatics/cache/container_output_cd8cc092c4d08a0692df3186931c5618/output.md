<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">

<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

This was originally introduced as "every pair of points within the same cluster should be closer to each other than any points each from different clusters", where "closer" was implying euclidean distance. I think the idea was intended to be abstracted out to the definition above since the items may not be thought of as "points" but as vectors or sequences + you can choose a similarity metric other than euclidean distance.
