Should you not be factoring in scoring somehow as well? For example, if you're calculating symbol emission probabilities for proteins, the BLOSUM / PAM scoring matrices tell you how likely it is for one amino acid to be replaced by another -- should be mixing this into the symbol emisison probabilities?
