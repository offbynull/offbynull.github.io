* Pr(Pi→Pi+1) denotes the probability of transitioning from one hidden state to the next. For example, the transition between 0 and 1 is Pr(fouler→hitter), which is 0.1. At the beginning, even before 0, the probability is set to 0.5 because there's a 50/50 chance of starting off with either hitter or fouler.
* Pr(Xi|Pi) denotes the conditional probability that the symbol will be emitted given the current hidden state. For example, at 0, the probability that foul is emitted given the hidden state is set to fouler is 0.4.
