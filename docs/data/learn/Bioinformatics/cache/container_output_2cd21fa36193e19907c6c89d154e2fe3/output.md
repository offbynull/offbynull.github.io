<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">

<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

The end is referencing *b* because *b* comes after *a* in lexicographic order. So, what the above "end" calculation is doing is getting the index of the initial *b* symbol instance and subtracting it by 1, which ends up being the index of the last *a* symbol instance.
