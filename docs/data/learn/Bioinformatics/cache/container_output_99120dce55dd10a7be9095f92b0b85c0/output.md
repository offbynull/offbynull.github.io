<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

This section doesn't cover de-noising or de-biasing. It only covers clustering and common similarity / distance metrics for real-valued vectors (which are what gene expression vectors are). Note that clustering can be used with data types other than vectors. For example, you can cluster protein sequences where the similarity metric is the BLOSUM62 score.
