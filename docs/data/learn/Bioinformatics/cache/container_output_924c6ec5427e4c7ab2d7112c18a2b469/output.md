<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">

<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

This is badly cobbled together code. It's taking the code from the previous section's example and embedding/duct-taping even more pieces from the sequence alignment module just to get a running example. In a perfect world I would just import the sequence alignment module, but that module lives in a separate container. This is the best I can do.

Running this is even slower than the previous section's example, so the sample size has been reduced even further.
