What's the significance of picking the node with the highest degree_GRAPH as the starting point? It was never explained, but I suspect it's a heuristic of some kind. Something like, the node with the highest degree_GRAPH is assumed to have most of its edges to other nodes in the same clique and as such it's the most "representative" member_CLUSTER of the cluster that clique represents.

Something like that.
