Still confused? Think of this as trying to match the pattern of movement but not the size. Imagine two 4-dimensional gene expression vectors with counts (1,9,1,9) and (3,7,3,7). If you were to plot out each component of the vectors, their patterns would look very similar ...

```{svgbob}
"plot of (1,9,1,9)'s components by index"      "plot of (3,7,3,7)'s components by index"

v 9|     *       *                             v 9|
a 7|    / \     /                              a 7|   *   *
l 5|   /   \   /                               l 5|  / \ / 
u 3|  /     \ /                                u 3| *   *  
e 1| *       *                                 e 1|
   +--------------                                +---------
     0   1   2   3                                  0 1 2 3
        index                                        index
```

The cosine of the angle between (1,9,1,9) and (3,7,3,7) is almost 1.0 (maximum similarity), meaning that the patterns are very similar even though the sizes aren't.
