<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

Why? Recall from Algorithms/Sequence Hidden Markov Models/Chained Transition-Emission Probability_TOPIC: The probability of symbol emission after a state transition is Pr(source-to-destination transition) * Pr(destination's emission). The probability of a chain of such transition-emission is their individual probabilities multiplied together.
