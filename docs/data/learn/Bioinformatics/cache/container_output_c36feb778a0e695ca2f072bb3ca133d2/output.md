<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

That's why it's called small parsimony: When the algorithm requires a tree structure before it infers sequences, it's called small parsimony. If the algorithm both generates both the tree structure and infers internal node sequences, such that the tree + inferred sequences generates the minimum possible distance out of all possible tree + inferred sequences, it's called large parsimony.

Trying to do large parsimony explodes the search space (e.g. NP-complete), meaning it isn't realistic to attempt.
