<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

In this case, computing backwards doesn't mean that the edges go in reverse direction. It just means that you're stepping backwards (from SINK) rather than stepping forward. So for example, ...

1. stepping backwards from SINK to A2 is calculated exactly the same as stepping forward from A2 forward to SINK: Pr(SINK→A) = 1.0.
2. stepping backwards from A2 to B1 is calculated exactly the same as stepping forward from B1 forward to A2: Pr(B→A|y).
