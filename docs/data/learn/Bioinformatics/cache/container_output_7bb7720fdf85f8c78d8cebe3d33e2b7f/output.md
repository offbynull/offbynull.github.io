The sub-section describes how to deal with time-courses. There is no sub-section describing how to deal with conditionals. The Pevzner book never went over it. But, the final challenge question did throw a conditional dataset at you and asked you to solve some problem. It seems that for conditional datasets, the key thing you need to do is filter out unrelated genes before doing anything. For the challenge in the Pevzner book, I simply compared a gene's average gene expression between cancer vs non-cancer to determine if it was relevant (if the offset was large enough, I decided it was relevant).
