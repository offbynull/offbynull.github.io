<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

The Pevzner book, in a later chapter (ch7 -- phylogeny), spends an entire section talking about character tables and how they can be thought of as sequences (character vectors). There's no good place to put this information. It seems non-critical so the only place it exists is in the terminology section.
