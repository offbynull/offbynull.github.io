<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

There's some ambiguity here on what the function being minimized / maximized is and how probabilities are derived. It seems like squared error distortion isn't involved here at all, so how is this related in any way to k-means? My understanding is that squared error distortion is what makes k-means.

It seems like this is called soft k-means because the high-level steps of the algorithm for this are similar to the Lloyd's algorithm heuristic. That's where the similarity ends (as far as I can tell). So maybe it should be called soft lloyd's algorithm instead? It looks like the generic name for this is called the [Expectation-maximization algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation%E2%80%93maximization_algorithm).
