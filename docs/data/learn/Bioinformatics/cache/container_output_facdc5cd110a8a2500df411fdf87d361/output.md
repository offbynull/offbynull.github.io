<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

For some emission index, the sum of certainties for hidden states that do emit should come to 1.0. For example, in the example run above, 1A=0.36 and 1B=0.64: 0.36+0.64=1.0.

But what does the certainty mean for non-emitting hidden states such as 1C? If it's 0.31 certain that it goes through hidden state 1C, then it's 1.0-0.31=0.69 certain that it goes through either 1A or 1B? But for it to reach 1C, it must travel over 1B, so maybe it's 0.69 certain that it only travels through 1A vs 1B→1C?
