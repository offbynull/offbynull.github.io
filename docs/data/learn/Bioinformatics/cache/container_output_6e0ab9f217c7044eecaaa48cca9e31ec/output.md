It's tough to get a handle on what the requirements are, if any, to call a tree a dendrogram: Is it restricted to 2 children per internal node (or can there be more)? Do the edges extending from an internal node have to be of equal weight (e.g. equidistant)? Does the tree have to be ultrametric? Does it have to be a rooted tree (or can it be an unrooted tree)?

It seems like you can call any tree, even unrooted trees, a dendrogram. This seems like a gate keeping term. "Draw the tree thta makes up the hierarchial cluster" vs "Draw the dendrogram that makes up the hierarchial cluster".
