<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

This algorithm seems totally useless, but it sets the foundation for other more efficient algorithms in further subsections. It isn't from the Pevzner book. It comes from me spending several days trying to figure out why the forward-backward algorithm works, and then trying to figure out a set of modifications to make it work for non-emitting hidden states. I don't know if I've reasoned about this correctly.
