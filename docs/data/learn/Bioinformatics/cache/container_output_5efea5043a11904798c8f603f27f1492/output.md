<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

The Pevzner book gives the analogy that centers are stars and points are planets. The closer a planet is to a star, the stronger that star's gravitational pull should be. This gravitational pull is the "confidence" -- a stronger pull means a stronger confidence. The analogy falls a bit flat because, in this case, it's the stars (centers) that are being pulled into the planets (points) -- normally it's the other way around (planets get pulled into stars).

I have no idea how the partition function actually works or know anything about statistical physics. The book also listed the formula for Newtonian inverse-square law of gravitation but mentioned that the partition function works better in practice. I think a simpler / more understandable metric may be used instead of either of these. The core thing it needs to do is assign a greater confidence to points that are closer than to those that are farther, where that confidence is between 0 and 1. Maybe some kind of re-worked / inverted version of squared error distortion would work here.
