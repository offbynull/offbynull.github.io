# Exercise Break: Prove that there exists a shortest sequence of reversals sorting a permutation that never breaks a
# permutation at an adjacency.

# I can write code to prove this for some specific length, but I don't know how to prove it for some arbitrary length?
# I don't know how to prove it in the abstract sense.
