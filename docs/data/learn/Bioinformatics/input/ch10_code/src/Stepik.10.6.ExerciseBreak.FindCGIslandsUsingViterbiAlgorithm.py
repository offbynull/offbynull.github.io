# Exercise Break: Apply your solution for the Decoding Problem to find CG-islands in the first million nucleotides from
# the human X chromosome (given in FASTA format). To help you design an HMM for this application, you may assume that
# transitions from CG-islands to non-CG-islands are rare, occurring with probability 0.001, and that transitions from
# non-CG-islands to CG-islands are even more rare, occurring with probability 0.0001. How many CG-islands do you find?
