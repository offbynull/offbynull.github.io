<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">

<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

Why do you need to apply to both sides? The math operations being tacked onto the expressions are essentially shifting / scaling those expressions. Since both sides are shifting / scaling by the same amount, balance is maintained. For example, imagine shifting 5 > 4 by the same amount on both sides ...

 * 5 > 4 (condition is met)
 * 5+1 > 4+1 (condition is met)
 * 5+999 > 4+999 (condition is met)

Likewise, imagine scaling 5 > 4 by the same non-zero amount on both sides (special cases like zero are handled in the upcoming text outside this note block)...

 * 5 > 4 (condition is met)
 * 5\*5 > 4\*5 (condition is met)
 * 5\*1000 > 4\*1000 (condition is met)

Other operations other than shifting / scaling may be allowed as well so long as they balance (I can't think of any more at the moment).
