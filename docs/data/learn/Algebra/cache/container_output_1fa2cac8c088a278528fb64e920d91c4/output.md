The following is my attempt at explaining Euclid's algorithm after reading several online resources. You need an understanding of geometry and algebra before continuing.

 * Geometric explanation

   Conceptually, you can think of Euclid's algorithm as recursively breaking off !!square!! chunks out of a rectangular area until it finds the smallest possible chunk that can be evenly copied to recreate the original rectangle. For example, imagine the numbers 21 and 6...
   
   ```{svgbob}
                  21
      +------------------------+
      |                        |
      |                        |
      |                        | 6
      +------------------------+
   ```
   
   Since in 21x6, 6 is the smaller side, break off 6 from the 21 to get a 6x6 block...
   
   ```{svgbob}
                      15
      +------+-----------------+
      |      |                 |
      | 6x6  |                 |
      |      |                 | 6
      +------+-----------------+
   ```
   
   Since in 15x6, 6 is the smaller side, break off 6 from the 15 to get a 6x6 block...
   
   ```{svgbob}
                          9
      +------+------+----------+
      |      |      |          |
      | 6x6  | 6x6  |          |
      |      |      |          | 6
      +------+------+----------+
   ```
   
   Since in 9x6, 6 is the smaller side, break off 6 from the 9 to get a 6x6 block...
   
   ```{svgbob}   
                             3
      +------+------+------+---+
      |      |      |      |   |
      | 6x6  | 6x6  | 6x6  |   |
      |      |      |      |   | 6
      +------+------+------+---+
   ```
   
   Since in 3x6, 6 is the smaller side, break off 3 from the 6 to get a 3x3 block...
   
   ```{svgbob}   
      +------+------+------+---+
      |      |      |      |3x3|
      | 6x6  | 6x6  | 6x6  +---+
      |      |      |      |   | 3
      +------+------+------+---+
                             3
   ```

   The remaining block is also 3x3 block. As such, the largest size that this entire rectangle can be constructed from is 3x3. The greatest common divisor is 3.
   
   ```{svgbob}   
      +------+------+------+---+
      |      |      |      |3x3|
      | 6x6  | 6x6  | 6x6  +---+
      |      |      |      |3x3|
      +------+------+------+---+
   ```

   Notice how this is subtracting from the larger side at each step. Since division is iterative subtraction, this entire algorithm can be done using division. Starting from the very beginning...

   ```{svgbob}
                  21
      +------------------------+
      |                        |
      |                        |
      |                        | 6
      +------------------------+
   ```
   
   Since in 21x6, 6 is the smaller side, break off as many blocks of 6 as possible from 21: `{kt} 21 \div 6 = 3R3` (3 blocks of 6x6, with 3 remaining)...

   ```{svgbob}   
                             3
      +------+------+------+---+
      |      |      |      |   |
      | 6x6  | 6x6  | 6x6  |   |
      |      |      |      |   | 6
      +------+------+------+---+
   ```

   Since in 3x6, 3 is the smaller side, break off as many blocks of 3 as possible from 6: `{kt} 21 \div 6 = 2R0` (2 blocks of 3x3, with 0 remaining)...

   ```{svgbob}   
      +------+------+------+---+
      |      |      |      |3x3|
      | 6x6  | 6x6  | 6x6  +---+
      |      |      |      |3x3|
      +------+------+------+---+
   ```

 * Algebraic explanation

   If 2 numbers are evenly divisible by some other number, then their sum/difference must also be divisible. For example, the numbers 21 and 6 are both divisible by 3:
   
   ```{svgbob}
         21 / 3 = 7R0                6 / 3 = 2R0
   
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+      +---+---+
   |xxx|xxx|xxx|xxx|xxx|xxx|xxx|      |xxx|xxx|
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+      +---+---+
   ```
   
   Since they're both divisible by 3, if you were to add 18 and 6 together, the sum would also be divisible by 3...
   
   ```{svgbob}
         21 / 3 = 7R0                6 / 3 = 2R0
   
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+      +---+---+
   |xxx|xxx|xxx|xxx|xxx|xxx|xxx|      |xxx|xxx|
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+      +---+---+
   
               |                          |
               |        21 + 6 = 27       |
               |                          |
               +-------------+------------+
                             |
                             v
           
                        27 / 3 = 9R0
          
          +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
          |xxx|xxx|xxx|xxx|xxx|xxx|xxx|xxx|xxx|
          +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   ```
   
   Similarly, if you were to subtract 21 and 6, the difference would also be divisible by 3...
   
   ```{svgbob}
         21 / 3 = 7R0                6 / 3 = 2R0
   
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+      +---+---+
   |xxx|xxx|xxx|xxx|xxx|xxx|xxx|      |xxx|xxx|
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+      +---+---+
   
               |                          |
               |        21 - 6 = 15       |
               |                          |
               +-------------+------------+
                             |
                             v
   
                        15 / 3 = 5R0
                   
                   +---+---+---+---+---+
                   |xxx|xxx|xxx|xxx|xxx|
                   +---+---+---+---+---+
   ```
   
   Even if you don't know what the divisor is, you can recursively break down the problem using the rules stated above. Imagine that you didn't know that 3 was the divisor for the previous example, but you know that some evenly divisible number `{kt} d` existed...
   
   * `{kt} \frac{21}{d} = xR0`
   * `{kt} \frac{6}{d} = yR0`
   
   Since you know that the if 21 and 6 are both divisible by d, their difference must also be divisible by d...
   
   * `{kt} \frac{21 - 6}{d} = \frac{15}{d} = zR0`
   
   Now you know that 3 numbers are divisible by d: 21, 6, 15. Since you know that 15 and 6 are both divisible by d, their difference must also be divisible by d...
   
   * `{kt} \frac{15 - 6}{d} = \frac{9}{d} = wR0`
   
   Now you know that 4 numbers are divisible by d: 21, 6, 15, and 9. Since you know that 15 and 9 are both divisible by d, their difference must also be divisible by d...
   
   * `{kt} \frac{15 - 9}{d} = \frac{6}{d} = vR0`
   
   Now you know that 5 numbers are divisible by d: 21, 6, 15, 9, and 6. Since you know that 9 and 6 are both divisible by d, their difference must also be divisible by d...
   
   * `{kt} \frac{9 - 6}{d} = \frac{3}{d} = uR0`

   Now you know that 6 numbers are divisible by d: 21, 6, 15, 9, 6, 3. Since you know that 9 and 6 are both divisible by d, their difference must also be divisible by d...
   
   * `{kt} \frac{3 - 3}{d} = \frac{0}{d} = uR0`

   `{kt} 3-3` is 0, so the algorithm stops at this point -- d is 3.

   ```{note}
   Notice how for each subtraction step, the last 2 numbers are being chosen. When subtracting, the larger number goes first -- always subtract FROM the larger number.
   ```
   
   You can plug 3 for d into the expressions above and each will evaluate to a whole number (no remainder). This algorithm is continually reducing the problem until it converges to the single greatest common divisor...
   
   * `{kt} a - b` is divisible by d because both a and b are divisible by d
   * `{kt} a - (a - b)` is divisible by d because both a and (a - b) are divisible by d
   * `{kt} a - (a - (a - b))`  is divisible by d because both a and (a - (a - b)) are divisible by d
   * ...
