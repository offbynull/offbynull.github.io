<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

Why can't all coefficients be 0? Consider `{kt} Ax+By=C`.

 * If A=0, B=0, and C≠0, no (x, y) ordered pair that would satisfy the equation (contradiction equation).
 * If A=0, B=0, and C=0, all (x, y) ordered pairs satisfy the equation (identity equation -- every point is on the line).
