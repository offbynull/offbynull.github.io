<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">

<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

The left-to-right evaluation for chains of division/multiplication (DM) and addition/subtraction (AS) is short-hand for implicitly adding brackets. For example, consider 8 + 0 - 1. Evaluating it left-to-right is the same as evaluating if brackets were added around each operation starting with the left-most pair going right-ward ... 

```
8 + 0 - 1      ... vs ...     ((8 + 0) - 1)
```
