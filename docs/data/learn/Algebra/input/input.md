# Terminology

 * `{bm} place value system/(place value system|place-value system|place value notation|place-value notation|positional numeral system)/i` - A way to represent a number. A number represented using the place value system is made up of a string of symbols separated by a dot, where each (index, symbol) combination in the string represents a value.

   The symbols used to represent a number are called `{bm} digit`s. All digits to the...

    * left of the dot represents entire objects, called the whole part.
    * right of the dot represents a partial object, called the fractional part.

   These wholes and fractional are combined to represent the final value for the number. For example, the number 43.5 represents...

 * `{bm} fraction/(fraction|numerator|denominator)/i` - A way of representing numbers with equally-sized partial objects. The syntax for a fraction is `{kt} \frac{numerator}{denominator}`, where the...

   * numerator (top) is an integer that represents the number of parts available.
   * denominator (bottom) is an integer that represents the number of parts in a whole.

   For example, if 4 parts make up a whole (denominator) and you have 9 of those parts (numerator), that's represented as `{kt} \frac{9}{4}`.
