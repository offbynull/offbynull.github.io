<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">

<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

Subtraction starts from 0, so it'd be...
1. 0 - 5 = -5
2. -5 - 5 = -10
3. -10 - 5 = -15

Or, you could use the commutative property of multiplication and swap the operands -- 3 \* -5 becomes -5 \* 3, exactly the same as the previous bullet point.
