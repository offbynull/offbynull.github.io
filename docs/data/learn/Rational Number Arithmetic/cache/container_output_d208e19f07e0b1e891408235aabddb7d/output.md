<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

You can also use prime factorization. Prime factorize both numbers to their prime factors -- any factors contained in both are prime factors of the greatest common divisor. For example...

* primeFactorize(22) is 2 \* 11.
* primeFactorize(8) is 2 \* 2 \* 2.

```{svgbob}
        +--+                +--+
22 "="  |2 |                |11|
        ++-+                +--+
         |
        ++-+   +--+   +--+
8  "="  |2 |   |2 |   |2 |
        ++-+   +--+   +--+
         |
         v
        +--+
GCD "=" |2 |
        +--+
```
