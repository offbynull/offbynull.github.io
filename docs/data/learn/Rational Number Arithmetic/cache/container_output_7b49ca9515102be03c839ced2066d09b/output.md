<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">

<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

Fewer than, smaller than, and `{bm-skip} less than` are more much more commonly used for the less than relational operator. For example...

* `{bm-skip} 3 less than 5 -- 3 - 5`
* `{bm-skip} 3 is less than 5 -- 3 < 5`

You'll need to disambiguate based on the context.
