<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">

<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

What's actually happening in the "merge" above is that the primes are being segmented by value and the segment with the highest occurrence count is being picked...

* prime 2 = {4=[2, 2], 6=[2]}
* prime 3 = {4=[], 6=[3]}

For prime 2, take from 4. From prime 3, take from 6.
</div>
