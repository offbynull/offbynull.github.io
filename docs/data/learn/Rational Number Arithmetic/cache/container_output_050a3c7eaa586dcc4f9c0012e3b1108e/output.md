<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">

<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

If a number (other than 0) is positive, the + sign is typically left out. So, ... 
* -5 is -5
+ +5 is +5
* 5 is +5
* 0 is 0
* there is no such thing as -0 (0 never has a sign).
* there is no such thing as +0 (0 never has a sign).
</div>
