Steps for conversion are as follows:

 1. denominator qualifies for conversion (1000).
 2. number of 0s in the denominator is 3.
 3. number of digits in the numerator is 1.
 4. 3 - 1 = 2.
 5. 00 gets prepended to 9 to become 009.
 6. resulting decimal is 2.009 .

Fraction conversion subsections below provide more in-depth discussion on how to conversions. However, those subsections require that you know how to do basic decimal number arithmetic before hand.
