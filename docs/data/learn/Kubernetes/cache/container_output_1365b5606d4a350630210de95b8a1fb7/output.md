<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

In addition to horizontal pod autoscaler, there's a vertical pod autoscaler (VPA). A VPA will scale a single pod based on metrics and its resource requests / resource limits.

The VPA kind doesn't come built-in with Kubernetes. It's provided as an add-on package found [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler).
