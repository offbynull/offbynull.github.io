<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

The book mentions why DNS can't be used directly. For example, having a basic DNS service which returns a list of all up-and-running pod IPs won't work because ...

1. applications and operating systems often cache DNS results, meaning that changes won't be visible immediately.
2. applications often only use the first IP given back by a DNS result, meaning that requests won't balance.

The service fixes this because it acts as a load balancing proxy and its IP / host never changes (DNS caching won't break anything).
