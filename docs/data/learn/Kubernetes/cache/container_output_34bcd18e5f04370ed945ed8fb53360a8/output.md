<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">

<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

The "5x more preferred" comment above is speculation. I've tried to look online to see how weights work but haven't been able to find much. Does it scale by whatever the highest weight is? So if the example above's first preference was 10 instead of 100, would it be preferred 0.5x as much (10:20 ratio)?
