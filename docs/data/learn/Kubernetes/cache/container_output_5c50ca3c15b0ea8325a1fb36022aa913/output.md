<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

I've spent hours trying to figure out how replicas can send custom metrics that an HPA can scale on. There is barely any documentation on this and zero examples online. The closest thing I could find to a source is [here](https://medium.com/swlh/building-your-own-custom-metrics-api-for-kubernetes-horizontal-pod-autoscaler-277473dea2c1).

The simplest solution here seems to be to use a third-party software package called Prometheus.
