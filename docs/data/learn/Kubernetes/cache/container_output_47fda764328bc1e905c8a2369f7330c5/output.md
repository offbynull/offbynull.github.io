What about `ImplementationSpecific`? There are different types of ingress controllers, each of which has its own configuration options. An ingress class is something you can put into your ingress object that contains "configuration including the name of the controller that should implement the class." It seems like an advanced topic and I don't know enough to write about it. Probably not something you have to pat attention to if you're doing basic cloud stuff.
