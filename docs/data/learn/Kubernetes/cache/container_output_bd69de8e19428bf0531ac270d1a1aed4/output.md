<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

The terminology here is a bit wishy-washy. Some places call them kinds, other places call them resources, other places call them classes, and yet other places call them straight-up objects (in this case, they mean kind but they're saying object). None of it seems consistent and sometimes terms are overloaded, which is why it's been difficult piecing together how Kubernetes works.

I'm using kind to refer to the different types of objects, and object to refer to an instance of a kind.
