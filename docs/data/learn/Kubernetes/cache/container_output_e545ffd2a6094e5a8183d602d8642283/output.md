<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">

<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

I'm still confused as to what this actually does. The example above gives permissions to the default service account in the `my-other-ns` namespace, but the `RoleBinding` is in the `my-ns` namespace. Does that mean the service account won't get permissions because it's in another namespace?
