<p><a name="BM_(game)%2Fi"></a><strong>game</strong> - An interactive situation where several <a href="#BM_(player)%2Fi">player</a>s take actions that effect each other. <sub><a href="http://faculty.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/bonanno/GT_Book.html">[GT2018:p11]</a></sub></p>

<p><a name="BM_(game%20theory)%2Fi"></a><strong>game theory</strong> - A formal language for the representation and analysis of <a href="#BM_(game)%2Fi">game</a>s. <sub><a href="http://faculty.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/bonanno/GT_Book.html">[GT2018:p11]</a></sub></p>

<p><a name="BM_(player)%2Fi"></a><strong>player</strong> - An agent that acts purposefully and logically to get as close as possible to a set of well-defined goals. What a <a href="#BM_(player)%2Fi">player</a> is depends on the context. For example, in the context of ...</p>
<ul>
<li>economic behaviour, a <a href="#BM_(player)%2Fi">player</a> is a human.</li>
<li>molecular biology, a <a href="#BM_(player)%2Fi">player</a> may be a pathogenic bacteria, immune cell, virus, etc..</li>
<li>computer simulations, a <a href="#BM_(player)%2Fi">player</a> is typically an artificial agent.</li>

<p><a name="BM_(cooperative%20game%20theory)%2Fi"></a><strong>cooperative game theory</strong> - A branch of <a href="#BM_(game%20theory)%2Fi">game theory</a> where <a href="#BM_(player)%2Fi">player</a>s can cooperate through communication, forming coalitions, and making binding agreements. An example of <a href="#BM_(cooperative%20game%20theory)%2Fi">cooperative game theory</a> is politics, where various groups often form larger coalitions. <sub><a href="http://faculty.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/bonanno/GT_Book.html">[GT2018:p12]</a></sub></p>

<p><a name="BM_(non-cooperative%20game%20theory)%2Fi"></a><strong>non-cooperative game theory</strong> - A branch of <a href="#BM_(game%20theory)%2Fi">game theory</a> where <a href="#BM_(player)%2Fi">player</a>s are either unable to communicate or unable to make binding agreements. An example of <a href="#BM_(non-cooperative%20game%20theory)%2Fi">non-cooperative game theory</a> is competing firms that are hampered from colluding due to anti-trust laws.  <sub><a href="http://faculty.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/bonanno/GT_Book.html">[GT2018:p12]</a></sub></p>

<p><a name="BM_(ordinal%20payoff%7Cordinal%20pay-off)%2Fi"></a><strong>ordinal payoff</strong> - A <a href="#BM_(game)%2Fi">game</a> where the preferences of discrete outcomes are ranked using numbers. For example, the preference for the type of cake to consume at a birthday party may be ...</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>no cake available</li>
<li>non-chocolate cake</li>
<li>chocolate cake</li>
</ol>
<p>Item 2 (chocolate cake) is preferable over item 1 (non-chocolate cake), which is preferable over 0 (no cake).  <sub><a href="http://faculty.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/bonanno/GT_Book.html">[GT2018:p12]</a></sub></p>

<li>
<p><a name="BM_(cardinal%20payoff)%2Fi"></a><strong>cardinal payoff</strong> - A <a href="#BM_(game)%2Fi">game</a> where the preference of outcome is based on quantities (e.g. amount of money) rather than a ranking of discrete items based on preference (<a href="#BM_(ordinal%20payoff%7Cordinal%20pay-off)%2Fi">ordinal payoff</a>s).  <sub><a href="http://faculty.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/bonanno/GT_Book.html">[GT2018:p12]</a></sub></p>
