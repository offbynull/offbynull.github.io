<p><a name="BM_(preference)%2Fi"></a><strong>preference</strong> - Given a set of outcomes, a <a href="#BM_(player)%2Fi">player</a>'s <a href="#BM_(preference)%2Fi">preference</a>s are the order in which those outcomes are desired. It's not safe to assume that all <a href="#BM_(player)%2Fi">player</a>s in a <a href="#BM_(game)%2Fi">game</a> are <a href="#BM_(selfish%20and%20greedy)%2Fi">selfish and greedy</a>. For example, a <a href="#BM_(player)%2Fi">player</a> may <a href="#BM_(benevolent%7Cbenevolence)%2Fi">benevolent</a> or <a href="#BM_(fair-minded)%2Fi">fair-minded</a>. <sub><a href="http://faculty.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/bonanno/GT_Book.html">[GT2018:p18]</a></sub></p>
<p>There are four common ways of representing <a href="#BM_(preference)%2Fi">preference</a>s. Imagine a scenario where, given the outcomes <code>{o1, o2, o3, o4}</code>, the <a href="#BM_(preference)%2Fi">preference</a> for those outcomes is <code>o3</code> is better than <code>o1</code>, which is just as good as <code>o4</code>, which in turn is better than <code>o2</code> (best is <code>o3</code>, worst is <code>o2</code>).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Relational notation - Represent which outcome has <a href="#BM_(preference)%2Fi">preference</a> over the other using ...</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&gt;</code>: <code>A &gt; B</code> means outcome A is better than outcome B.</li>
<li><code>==</code>: <code>A == B</code> means outcome A is just as good as outcome B.</li>
</ul>
<p>These <a href="#BM_(preference)%2Fi">preference</a>s are typically written chained together (e.g. <code>A &gt; B == C</code> is equivalent to <code>A &gt; B and B == C</code>). <sub><a href="http://faculty.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/bonanno/GT_Book.html">[GT2018:p20]</a></sub></p>
<p>The scenario above would be represented as <code>o3 &gt; o1 == o4 &gt; o2</code>.</p>
<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">
<p><strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong></p>
<p>The book also provides the following notation: <code>&gt;=</code>, where <code>A &gt;= B</code> means outcome <code>A</code> is at least as good as outcome <code>B</code>. Then it goes through a convoluted section that explains <code>&gt;</code> and <code>==</code> can be represented just by <code>&gt;=</code>. For example, given two outcomes <code>{A, B}</code>, the relation ...</p>
<ul>
<li><code>A == B</code> can be represented using just <code>&gt;=</code> as <code>A &gt;= B and B &gt;= A</code>.</li>
<li><code>A &gt; B</code> can be represented using just <code>&gt;=</code> as <code>A &gt;= B and not(B &gt;= A)</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem is, I don't know what "at least as good as" means in terms of the desire for an outcome. If something A is "at least as good as" B (e.g. <code>A &gt;= B</code>), there's the possibility that I'll gain more from A vs B, so why wouldn't I always prefer A over B?</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cartesian product - Given the cartesian product of the outcomes with itself, keep only the ordered pairs <code>(A, B)</code> where <code>A</code> is at least desired as much as <code>B</code>. <sub><a href="http://faculty.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/bonanno/GT_Book.html">[GT2018:p20]</a></sub></p>
<p>The scenario above would be represented as follows.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>{
  (o1, o1), (o1, o4), (o1, o2),
  (o2, o2),
  (o3, o3), (o3, o1), (o3, o4), (o3, o2),
  (o4, o4), (o4, o1), (o4, o2)
}
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ranked list - Represent which outcome has <a href="#BM_(preference)%2Fi">preference</a> as a list from best-to-worst, where equally desired outcomes are put into the same index.  <sub><a href="http://faculty.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/bonanno/GT_Book.html">[GT2018:p21]</a></sub></p>
<p>The scenario above would be represented as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>o3</li>
<li>o1 and o4</li>
<li>o2</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Number assignment - Represent which output has <a href="#BM_(preference)%2Fi">preference</a> by assigning a number to each outcome, where larger numbers are desired more than smaller numbers. <sub><a href="http://faculty.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/bonanno/GT_Book.html">[GT2018:p21]</a></sub></p>
<p>The scenario above could be represented as the following mapping <code>{o3=30, o1=19, o4=19, o2=6}</code>.</p>
<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">
<p><strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong></p>
<p>Assigning numbers in this way is sometimes referred to as a <a href="#BM_(utility%20function%7Cutility)%2Fi">utility function</a>. <sub><a href="http://faculty.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/bonanno/GT_Book.html">[GT2018:p21]</a></sub></p>

<li>
<p><a name="BM_(utility%20function%7Cutility)%2Fi"></a><strong>utility function</strong> - Given a set of outcomes and <a href="#BM_(preference)%2Fi">preference</a>s for those outcomes, a <a href="#BM_(utility%20function%7Cutility)%2Fi">utility function</a> assigns a number to each outcome, where that number identifies that outcome's ranking in terms of <a href="#BM_(preference)%2Fi">preference</a>. Given two outcomes A and B, if ...</p>
<ul>
<li>A is more desired than B (<code>A&gt;B</code>), A is assigned a higher number than B.</li>
<li>A is equally desired as B (<code>A==B</code>), A is assigned the same number as B.</li>
</ul>
<p><sub><a href="http://faculty.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/bonanno/GT_Book.html">[GT2018:p21]</a></sub></p>
<p>The numbers are simply identifying ranking based on best-to-worst, they aren't quantities. <sub><a href="http://faculty.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/bonanno/GT_Book.html">[GT2018:p21]</a></sub> As such, there are an infinity number of <a href="#BM_(utility%20function%7Cutility)%2Fi">utility function</a>s that represent the same <a href="#BM_(preference)%2Fi">preference</a>. <sub><a href="http://faculty.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/bonanno/GT_Book.html">[GT2018:p22]</a></sub> For example, <code>o3 &gt; o1 == o4 &gt; o2</code> may be mapped by a <a href="#BM_(utility%20function%7Cutility)%2Fi">utility function</a> as <code>{o3=30, o1=19, o4=19, o2=6}</code>, <code>{o3=3, o1=2, o4=2, o2=-50}</code>, <code>{o3=70, o1=3, o4=3, o2=1}</code>, etc..</p>
<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">
<p><strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong></p>
<p>If the outcomes are drink Coke vs drink Sprite and the <a href="#BM_(utility%20function%7Cutility)%2Fi">utility function</a> assigns `{Coke=30, Sprite=10}, that doesn't mean Coke is 3 times more as desired as Sprite. It simply means Coke is preferred over Sprite.</p>
