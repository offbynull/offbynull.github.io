# Terminology

 * `{bm} game` - An interactive situation where several players take actions that effect each other. `{ref} gt:p11`

 * `{bm} game theory` - A formal language for the representation and analysis of games. `{ref} gt:p11`

 * `{bm} player` - An agent that acts purposefully and logically to get as close as possible to a set of well-defined goals. What a player is depends on the context. For example, in the context of ...

 * `{bm} cooperative game theory` - A branch of game theory where players can cooperate through communication, forming coalitions, and making binding agreements. An example of cooperative game theory is politics, where various groups often form larger coalitions. `{ref} gt:p12`

 * `{bm} non-cooperative game theory` - A branch of game theory where players are either unable to communicate or unable to make binding agreements. An example of non-cooperative game theory is competing firms that are hampered from colluding due to anti-trust laws.  `{ref} gt:p12`

 * `{bm} ordinal payoff/(ordinal payoff|ordinal pay-off)/i` - A game where the preferences of discrete outcomes are ranked using numbers. For example, the preference for the type of cake to consume at a birthday party may be ...

   0. no cake available
   1. non-chocolate cake
   2. chocolate cake

   Item 2 (chocolate cake) is preferable over item 1 (non-chocolate cake), which is preferable over 0 (no cake).  `{ref} gt:p12`

 * `{bm} cardinal payoff` - A game where the preference of outcome is based on quantities (e.g. amount of money) rather than a ranking of discrete items based on preference (ordinal payoffs).  `{ref} gt:p12`
