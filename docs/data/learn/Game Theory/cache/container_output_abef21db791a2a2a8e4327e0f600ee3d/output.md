The book also provides the following notation: `>=`, where `A >= B` means outcome `A` is at least as good as outcome `B`. Then it goes through a convoluted section that explains `>` and `==` can be represented just by `>=`. For example, given two outcomes `{A, B}`, the relation ...

* `A == B` can be represented using just `>=` as `A >= B and B >= A`.
* `A > B` can be represented using just `>=` as `A >= B and not(B >= A)`.

The problem is, I don't know what "at least as good as" means in terms of the desire for an outcome. If something A is "at least as good as" B (e.g. `A >= B`), there's the possibility that I'll gain more from A vs B, so why wouldn't I always prefer A over B?
