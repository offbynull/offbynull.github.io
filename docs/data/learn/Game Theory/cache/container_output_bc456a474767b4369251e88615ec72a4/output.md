It's easier to think of this in terms of a reduced game in strategic-form table. For example, the game above is represented as follows.

|                | B: Truth |  B: Lie |
|----------------|----------|---------|
| A: Lie         |  [4, 1]  | [3, 10] |
| A: Get Violent |  [2, 3]  | [2, 6]  |
| A: Stay Silent |  [4, 1]  | [3, 10] |

For Alice, each Lie payoff is greater than the corresponding Get Violent payoff (4>2 and 3>2), as such Lie strictly dominates Get Violent.
