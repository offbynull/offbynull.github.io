<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">

<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

What purpose does this actually serve? Mimicking 1 long read as n shorter reads isn't equivalent to actually having sequenced those n shorter reads. For example, what if the longer read being broken up has an error? That error replicates when breaking into n shorter reads, which gives a false sense of having good coverage and makes it seems as if it wasn't an error.
