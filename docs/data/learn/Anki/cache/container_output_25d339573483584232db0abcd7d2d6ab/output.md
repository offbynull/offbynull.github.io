<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

I think what the last bullet point means is that the distance will be >= if you travel to it indirectly (hop over to it instead of taking a straight path). For example, if dist(B,C) = 5, then dist(A,B) + dist(A,C) must be >= 5.

```{svgbob}
     C
     *
    / \
 3 /   \ 3
  /     \
 *-------*
A    5    B
```

A, B, and C are species.
