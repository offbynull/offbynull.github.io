<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">

<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

If `{kt} x^n` is even, its `{kt} \frac{1}{n}` counterpart will only show one half of the graph. This is because a function can only have 1 output for each input (1 y for each x -- if both halves are kept it'd violate the rules of a function).
