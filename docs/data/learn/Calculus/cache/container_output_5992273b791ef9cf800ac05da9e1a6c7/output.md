<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

The limit laws above expect both limits to exist. If a limit doesn't exist (e.g. its one-sided limits end up at different numbers (infinity is not a number) / one of its one-sided limits doesn't exist), limit laws may still be applicable for one of its one-sided limits. That is, you may apply limit laws to a one-sided limit provided that one-sided limit exists.
