<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">

<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

If using -∞ / ∞, you must use circular brackets, because infinity isn't something that can be reached. It just indicates a direction that goes on forever. For example, `{kt} (-\infty, 10]` or `{kt} (-\infty, \infty)`.
