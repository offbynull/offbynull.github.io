<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

Note what's happening here. The first term in the quotient is `{kt} 2x^2` because when you multiply it by the divisor `{kt} (x-2)` it results in `{kt} 2x^3+x^2`. Subtracting `{kt} 2x^3+x^2` from the dividend completely eliminates the 2x^3 from the dividend.

This same process continues for each term in the quotient.
