<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

This example was the only one listed in the learning material. What's the moral of the story here? If you can't use algebra and limit laws, look at the range of the inner functions and try to work something out with the squeeze theorem inequalities?

All the squeeze theorem examples I find online have sine / cosine involved (they're all a play on the example above). Is this applicable in some other context? I can't think up an example that isn't already solvable by using algebra + limit laws.
