<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

There's some strangeness when n is odd and > 1. Desmos graphs things out similar to how the book has them graphed out, but for my grapher negative x values are returning complex numbers. Not sure how to handle it. Some discussion [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/egd3tt/cube_root_of_a_negative_number_returns_a_complex/).
