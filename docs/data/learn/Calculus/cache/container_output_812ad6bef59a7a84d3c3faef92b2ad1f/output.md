<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

Why? The set of possible inputs (domain) into sine is the same here as it is in 1 (except x=0 is not allowed because `{kt} \frac{1}{0}` is undefined). It's just that if ...

* `{kt} x<1` then the number being fed into sine is `{kt} >1`.
* `{kt} x>1` then the number being fed into sine is `{kt} <1`.

As such, the set of possible outputs (range) is the same.
