The "five common rules" as according to the book:

|                             Rule                                  |                 Example                |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Multiplicative constants can be omitted                           | O(c*n) grows same as O(n)              |
| Smaller terms can be omitted                                      | O(n+5) grows same a O(n)               |
| Out of two polynomials, the one with a larger degree grows faster | O(n^3) grows faster than O(n^2)        |
| Any polynomial grows slower than exponential                      | O(2^n) grows faster than O(n^2)        |
| Any polylogarithm grows slower than a polynomial                  | O(n^2) grows faster than O((log(n))^2) |

Note that a polylogarithm is a function in the form log(n)^a.
