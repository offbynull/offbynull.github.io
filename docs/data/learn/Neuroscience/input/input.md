# Synapse Properties

* Average number of axon terminals per neuron: 10s on average
* Average number of dendritic spine per neuron: 100s to 1000s spines on average
* Average to,e fpr neurotransmitters to release and then bind: 100 to several hundred microseconds
* Average time for neurotransmitters to build up in the axon terminal: a few hundred microseconds
* Average time for neurotransmitters to change electrical charge of post-synaptic neuron: a couple of microseconds
* Average amount of voltage change required for a neuron to fire: +/- 40 to 50 mv
* A single action potential can take up to 500-1000ms on average
* Excitement has to be maintained at a certain rate to maintain an increased charge (see resting membrane potential)

Two types of neurotransmitters: inhibitory (we're primarily going to just say its GABA) vs excitatory (we're going to just say its glutamate)

# Terminology

 * `{bm} neuron` - A cell that processes information, as electrical and chemical signals, that resides primarily in the brain.

 * `{bm} soma` - The body of a neuron cell.

 * `{bm} dendrite` - The part of the neuron that's responsible for receiving information (electrochemical) through synapses. A neuron can have 1 or more dendrites.

 * `{bm} axon` - The part of the neuron that's responsible for sending information (electrical, chemical, or electrochemical) through synapses. A neuron can have only 1 axon, but that axon can feed into multiple dendrites or somas.

 * `{bm} synapse` - A point of contact between two neurons that allows electrical and / or chemical signals to pass one-way. A synapse is comprised of both a portion of the axon, called an axon terminal, and receiving dendrites or soma (synapses can form at both dendrites and somas).

 * `{bm} axon terminal` - Pre-synaptic part of the synapse.

 * `{bm} dendritic spine` - Post-synaptic part of the synapse when that synapse is part of a dendrite.

 * `{bm} pre-synaptic` - A neuron that is on the sending side of a synapse.

 * `{bm} post-synaptic` - A neuron that is on the receiving side of a synapse.

 * `{bm} synaptic cleft` - The space between between the pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neuron. The synaptic cleft is part of the synapse, not excluded or a different structure.

 * `{bm} neurotransmitter` - The chemical signal secreted from pre-synaptic to post-synaptic, to effect the post-synaptic neuron. The neurotransmitter, once it binds to either the dendritic spine or soma (post-synaptic neuron), gets converted to electrical signal again through ion channels.

 * `{bm} inhibitory neuron` - A neuron that inhibits the electrical activity of the post-synaptic neuron (receiving neuron). These neurons broadly contain GABA neurotransmitters.

 * `{bm} excitatory neuron` - A neuron that increases the electrical activity of the post-synoptic neuron (sending neuron). These neurons broadly contain glutamate neurotransmitters.

 * `{bm} action potential` - A neuron's electrical discharge (a rapid sequence of changes in voltage across cell membrane), built up over time until the neuron reaches some voltage threshold where it releases the discharge.

   The electrical signal that propagates through the axon, hitting the axon's various axon terminals along the way. Each axon terminal releases a certain neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft, which then propagates to the post-synaptic neuron.
 
 * `{bm} resting membrane potential` - A neuron's resting voltage, where it isn't firing the action potential.
