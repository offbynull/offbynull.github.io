<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">

<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

For interval scale, can't you just make a arbitrary starting point? For example, treat midnight as the starting point. Then you would be able to take a ratio.

I suppose if you gave it a starting point, it wouldn't be interval scale anymore. It would be ratio scale.
