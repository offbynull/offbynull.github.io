<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

For the addition principle, the sets being input have to be disjoint sets. For the multiplication principle, the sets don't have to be disjoint sets. For example, multiplication principle applied to set {0,1,2} and {0,1,2} is 9.

|   |   0   |   1   |   2   |
|---|-------|-------|-------|
| 0 | (0,0) | (0,1) | (0,2) |
| 1 | (1,0) | (1,1) | (1,2) |
| 2 | (2,0) | (2,1) | (2,2) |
