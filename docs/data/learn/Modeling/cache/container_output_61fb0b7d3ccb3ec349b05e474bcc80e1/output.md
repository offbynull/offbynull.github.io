I had a lot of problems understanding "occur_PR" with regards to conditional probability.

* From Wikipedia: An event S is said to occur_PR if S contains the outcome x of the experiment (or trial) (that is, if x∈S).
* From Wikipedia: conditional probability is a measure of the probability of an event occurring_PR, given that another event (by assumption, presumption, assertion or evidence) has already occurred_PR.

Here's how I'm understanding it:

* For event A to occur_PR, it !!means!! that the experiment's outcome is one of the outcomes in event A.
* For event A to have occurred_PR, it !!means!! the experiment's outcome is known to be limited to the outcomes of event A (sample space reduced).

Events A and B occurring_PR _does not !!mean!!_ that there were two back-to-back experiments / trails / draws, where event A comes out first and event B comes out second. There seems to be specific notation for the probability of two back-to-back draws: P(A→B).
