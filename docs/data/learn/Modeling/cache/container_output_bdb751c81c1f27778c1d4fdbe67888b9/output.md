<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

This is using the definition of percentiles as provided in the book. That is, if the number of elements in the data is even, then the median is the average of the two middle values (two middle values divided by 2).

It looks like the definition of median explicitly expects this averaging if there isn't exactly one middle value. Other types of interpolation allowed?
