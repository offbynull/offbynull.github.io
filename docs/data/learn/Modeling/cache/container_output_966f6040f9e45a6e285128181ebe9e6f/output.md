Another form of graph, called a frequency polygon, is essentially a histogram with lines rather than bars. That is, instead of bars, a point is inserted where the top-middle of each bar is and a line is used to connect each point to the point immediately on its right. 

People sometimes use frequency polygons when comparing multiple data sets. It's easier to show overlapping lines than it is to show overlapping bars.
