<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

This part originally came from ch1.2 of the book. I moved it out to a note because I can't verify it:

> While true random sampling is performed with replacement, it's sometimes more practical to sample without replacement. For example, having members of a population fill out a survey is an example of sampling without replacement (once a member fills out a survey, that member won't be selected to fill out the survey again). For large populations where a small number of members are being sampled, it typically won't matter if the sample is with replacement or without replacement. It becomes an issue when the population size is small. `{ref}osis:1.2`
