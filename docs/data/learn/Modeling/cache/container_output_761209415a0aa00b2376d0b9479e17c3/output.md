<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

It's important to note that when someone says *at* nth percentile, they aren't talking about a range or group of data points. They're typically talking about the specific data point at that percentile (e.g. 16th person).

However, when they say *in* the nth percentile, they may be talking about the range of data points up the one at the nth percentile.
