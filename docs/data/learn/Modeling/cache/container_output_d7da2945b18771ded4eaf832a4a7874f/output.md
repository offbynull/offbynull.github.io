<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

"... the data point before and the data point after are averaged together" doesn't sound like a hard and fast rule. It's just a crappy method of interpolation offered by the book because it's simple? It sounds like you can choose other types of interpolation.

The book does a bad job of explaining percentiles. I had to get help from many other resources (including asking online). Some of what I wrote / coded may not be entirely correct.
