The example above involves the physical act of counting, but the subtraction principle applies even in the case of algorithmic counting. For example, if you know the size of the universal set (set U) and it's easy to determine the number of excluded objects (set A') via the multiplication principle, then you can use the multiplication principle to determine the number of objects that you're interested in (set A).
