<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

The way conditionally probability is normally describes is "The probability that event A occurs_PR given that event B already occurred_PR". This is confusing because the word !!occur!! is used. It makes it sound as if this is a sequence of events when that's not what's happening. What's happening is that additional information is being made available that reduces the sample space.
