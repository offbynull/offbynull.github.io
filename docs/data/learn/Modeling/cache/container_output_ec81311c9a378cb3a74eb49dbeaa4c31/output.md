<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

The book mentions that if you have a data set, and you add together the deviations for each data point, the sum should be 0. For example, the data set [1, 5, 6] has a mean_ST of 4: (4-1) + (4-5) + (4-6) = 0.

The point it's making is that you can't add up deviations to get the spread of data. That's why variance squares the deviations. The square of a negative number is positive.
