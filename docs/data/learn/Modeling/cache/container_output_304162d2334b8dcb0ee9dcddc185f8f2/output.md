<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

If you stack the slices/layers shown above, you'd get the first 4 layers of the 3-simplex (3-simples as in 3 dimensions, Pascal's pyramid). A pyramid has 4 sides: 1 bottom and 3 others that combine to form the top. Each of the 3 top-forming sides isolated is Pascal's triangle.

For example, just stacking the right edge of the layers above will give you Pascal's triangle. The Wikipedia page has a more helpful 3D diagram.
