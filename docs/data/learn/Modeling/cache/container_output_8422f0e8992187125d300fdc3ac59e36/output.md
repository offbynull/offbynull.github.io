<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

Discrete random variable must be a whole number or an integer number? For example, is it possible for a discrete random variable output -1?

I keep seeing finite/countably infinite vs. uncountable/continuous thrown around to describe the difference between discrete random variable vs continuous random variable.
