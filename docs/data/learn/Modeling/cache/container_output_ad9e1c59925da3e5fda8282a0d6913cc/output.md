<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

Histograms aren't typically used for nominal scale or ordinal scale data because there is no !!meaningful!! ordering to that type of data. For those, you'd better off using a bar chart. Remember, with histogram, the x-axis is using the !!meaningful!! ordering of the data to figure out where to put each bucket (ascending order).
