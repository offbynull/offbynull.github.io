<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

For dependent events, the conditional probability must be a known value. You can't expand out the conditional probability in the equation because the formula will then infinitely recurse.

* `{kt}                 P(A \cap B)  = P(A) \cdot P(A|B)`
* `{kt} \textcolor{red}{P(A \cap B)} = P(A) \cdot \frac{\textcolor{red}{P(A \cap B)}}{P(B)}`
