<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

Some tips offered up by the learning material:

* VPCs should have unique address ranges, so that if you ever have to peer them together, you won't get conflicting addresses.
* When creating subnets, always explicitly choose the AZ rather than letting AWS choose for you (so you explicitly know where it is).
