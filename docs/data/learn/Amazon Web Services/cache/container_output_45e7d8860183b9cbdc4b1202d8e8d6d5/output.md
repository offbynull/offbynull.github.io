The learning material claims that, ...

* VPC peering doesn't allow you to share software-defined networking resources: NATs, VPNs, IGWs, etc.. (e.g. if A and B are peered, A cannot use B's IGW).
* VPCs can be peered across regions, but such peering doesn't support IPv6 (only IPv4).
* VPCs cannot peer if they have overlapping IP ranges.
