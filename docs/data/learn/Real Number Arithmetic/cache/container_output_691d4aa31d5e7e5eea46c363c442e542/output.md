1. It's acceptable to use the word "positive" when the sign is positive (recall 0 is neither positive nor negative).
2. It's acceptable to use the word "minus" instead of "negative." However, doing so may introduce ambiguity if the words are being used in the context of subtraction because minus also means subtraction.
