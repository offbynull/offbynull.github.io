The diagram below looks daunting but it's just 3 copies of the diagrams above stacked on top of each other -- 1 for each iteration. The remainders from each iteration are being combined and used as the input for the next iteration. The quotients from each iteration are being combined to get the total quotient (total number of groups).

The diagram is intended to be an intermediary step to reasoning about long division. There's further simplification / explanation after it.
