The details below describe each sub-rule as well as the algorithm to process that sub-rule. None of the algorithms use actual numbers / number operations -- value is tracked by iteratively pushing blocks into arrays. Why create an algorithm without using numbers? Using numbers to describe numbers is circular logic.
