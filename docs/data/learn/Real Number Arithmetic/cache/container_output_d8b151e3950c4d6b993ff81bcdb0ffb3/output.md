<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">

<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

An easier way to do the same thing is...
 1. add an extra index.
 1. set the first index to 1.
 1. set all other indexes to 0.
 
So if the fractional string has 2 digits (as 55 does), the total number of parts would be 100.

The reason why the code above doesn't do this is because I'm trying to avoid the use of numbers and operations that haven't been introduced yet.
