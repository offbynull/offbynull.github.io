<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

There are certain special words that denote multiplication. For example, the word `{bm} twice` means 2 multiplied by something else -- e.g. twice 5 is the same thing as 2*5.

Much less common is the word `{bm} thrice` -- it means 3 times something else. The pattern here seems to be the add "ice" to the end of the number? Unsure, but Google seems to give a definition for fourice.
