<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">

<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

More than, larger than, and `{bm-skip} greater than` are more much more commonly used for the greater than relational operator. For example...

* `{bm-skip} 5 greater than 3 -- 5 + 3`
* `{bm-skip} 5 is greater than 3 -- 5 > 3`

You'll need to disambiguate based on the context.
