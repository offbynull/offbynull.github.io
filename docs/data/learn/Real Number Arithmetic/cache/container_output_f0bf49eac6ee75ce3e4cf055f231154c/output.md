I haven't seen it done a lot but the term quotient may be used to describe a fraction. Since a fraction is essentially an unresolved division operation, the fraction as a whole represents the quotient. As such, a fraction can be referred to as a quotient.

The term ratio may also be used to refer to a fraction.
