The traditional way this is stated when being taught in school is "how many times can 7 go into 3?". Essentially, find the minimum number that the quotient can be without exceeding the component.

* 3\*0 = 0
* 3\*1 = 3
* 3\*2 = 6
* 3\*3 = 9 <-- too large, must be 7 or less, so pick the last one

```{kthelper}
LongDivision
   {2}
{3}{752}
```

Put the answer to 3\*2 = 6 underneath the component, then subtract to get the remainder...

```{kthelper}
LongDivision
   {2}
{3}{752}
   {\underline{6}}
   {1}
```
</div>
