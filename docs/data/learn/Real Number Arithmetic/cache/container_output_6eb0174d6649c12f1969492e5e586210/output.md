<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">

<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

Know exponents? Doing 10^fractional.length is the same thing.
 
If the fractional string has 2 digits (as 55 does), the total number of parts would be 10^2=100.

The reason why the code above doesn't do this is because I'm trying to avoid the use of numbers and operations that haven't been introduced yet.
