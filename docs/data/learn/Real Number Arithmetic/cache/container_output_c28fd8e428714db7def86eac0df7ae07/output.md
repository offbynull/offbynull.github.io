<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

The numerator and denominator in the fractional parts both start with 1 followed by zero or more 0s. These fractional parts can be done quickly using a trick. If...

* both numerators are followed by 0s, the resulting fraction will have as many 0s as both fractions.

  e.g. `{kt} \frac{10}{1}` * `{kt} \frac{100}{1}` = `{kt} \frac{1000}{1}`

* both denominators are followed by 0s, the resulting denominator will have as many 0s as both fractions.

  e.g. `{kt} \frac{1}{10}` * `{kt} \frac{1}{100}` = `{kt} \frac{1}{1000}`

* a numerator and a denominator both are followed by 0s, count the number of 0s in the one with less 0s and remove that many 0s from the other.
 
  e.g. `{kt} \frac{1}{10}` * `{kt} \frac{1000}{1}` = `{kt} \frac{100}{1}`

  e.g. `{kt} \frac{100}{1}` * `{kt} \frac{1}{10}` = `{kt} \frac{10}{1}`
