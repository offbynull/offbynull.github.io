<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">

<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

The phrases `{bm} evenly divisible`, `{bm} evenly divide`s and divisible all mean the same thing.

The phrase `{bm} evenly divides into` is the same as `{bm} divides into` but that it doesn't have a remainder. 4 divides into 8 (4/8=2), but 6 doesn't divide into 8 (6/8=0.75).
