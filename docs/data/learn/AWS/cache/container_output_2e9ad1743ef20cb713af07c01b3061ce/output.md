<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

Encrypted volumes result in encrypted snapshots, and encrypted snapshots result in encrypted volumes. While you can't encrypt a volume after you've created it, what you can do is snapshot it, encrypt the snapshot, and then restore that snapshot. The restored snapshot will be in an encrypted volume because the snapshot was encrypted.
