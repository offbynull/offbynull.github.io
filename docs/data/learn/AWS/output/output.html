<p>The reason for this is that the underlying technology and prices will change as years go by, but the concepts will likely stay the time.</p>

<p>An <a href="#BM_(Amazon%20resource%20name)%2Fi">Amazon Resource Name</a> (<a href="#BM_%5Cb(ARN)s%3F%5Cb%2F">ARN</a>) is an identifier that uniquely identifies a resource across all <a href="#BM_%5Cb(AWS)%5Cb%2F">AWS</a>, not just a single <a href="#BM_%5Cb(AWS)%5Cb%2F">AWS</a> account. Generally, an <a href="#BM_%5Cb(ARN)s%3F%5Cb%2F">ARN</a> should be in one of the following formats, ...</p>
<ul>
<li><code>arn:{partition}:{service}:{region}:{account-id}:{resource-id}</code></li>
<li><code>arn:{partition}:{service}:{region}:{account-id}:{resource-type}/{resource-id}</code></li>
<li><code>arn:{partition}:{service}:{region}:{account-id}:{resource-type}:{resource-id}</code></li>
</ul>
<p>..., where ...</p>
<ul>
<li><code>{partition}</code> is the segment of <a href="#BM_%5Cb(AWS)%5Cb%2F">AWS</a> (e.g. <code>aws</code> for normal <a href="#BM_%5Cb(AWS)%5Cb%2F">AWS</a>, <code>aws-cn</code> for <a href="#BM_%5Cb(AWS)%5Cb%2F">AWS</a> in China, and <code>aws-us-gov</code> for <a href="#BM_%5Cb(AWS)%5Cb%2F">AWS</a> GovCloud)</li>
<li><code>{service}</code> identifies the <a href="#BM_%5Cb(AWS)%5Cb%2F">AWS</a> product / service (e.g. <code>ec2</code> or <code>s3</code>).</li>
<li><code>{region}</code> is the geographic <a href="#BM_(region)%2Fi">region</a> being targeted (e.g. <code>us-east-1</code>).</li>
<li><code>{account-id}</code> is the ID of the <a href="#BM_%5Cb(AWS)%5Cb%2F">AWS</a> account that owns the resource.</li>
<li><code>{resource-type}</code> is type of resource being targeted (e.g. <code>vpc</code>).</li>
<li><code>{resource-id}</code> is the identifier for the resource.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example <code>arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/jimmy</code> and <code>arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:example-topic</code> are valid <a href="#BM_%5Cb(ARN)s%3F%5Cb%2F">ARN</a>s.</p>
<p>For some services, <code>{region}</code> and <code>{account-id}</code> should be omitted as the service's resources are unique across the entirety of <a href="#BM_%5Cb(AWS)%5Cb%2F">AWS</a>. For example, there can only be one <a href="#BM_%5Cb(S3%20bucket)s%3F%5Cb%2F">S3 bucket</a> name <code>my_bucket</code> across all of accounts and <a href="#BM_(region)%2Fi">region</a>s in <a href="#BM_%5Cb(AWS)%5Cb%2F">AWS</a>: <code>arn:aws:s3:::my_bucket/Directory1</code>.</p>
<p>Should the service not have unique resources across all of <a href="#BM_%5Cb(AWS)%5Cb%2F">AWS</a> but <code>{region}</code> and <code>{account-id}</code> are still omitted, the default <a href="#BM_(region)%2Fi">region</a> and the default account ID are used. For example, <code>arn:aws:ec2:::instance/my-instance</code> will target the default <a href="#BM_(region)%2Fi">region</a> and implicitly load in the account ID.</p>
<p>An <a href="#BM_%5Cb(ARN)s%3F%5Cb%2F">ARN</a> may include wildcards. For example, <code>arn:aws:s3:::my_bucket</code> targets an individual <a href="#BM_%5Cb(S3%20bucket)s%3F%5Cb%2F">S3 bucket</a>, but <code>arn:aws:s3:::my_bucket/*</code> targets all the contents of that bucket.</p>
<a name="H_Identity%20and%20Access%20Management"></a><h1>Identity and Access Management</h1>
<p><a name="BM_(Identity%20and%20Access%20Management)_TOPIC%2Fi"></a><strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="#BM_(identity%20and%20access%20management%7Cidentity%20%26%20access%20management)%2Fi">Identity and access management</a> (<a href="#BM_%5Cb(IAM)%5Cb%2F">IAM</a>) is <a href="#BM_%5Cb(AWS)%5Cb%2F">AWS</a>'s mechanism of managing authentication and authorization. It controls which entities (e.g. authenticates human users or software services) can access which parts of an <a href="#BM_%5Cb(AWS)%5Cb%2F">AWS</a> account (e.g. authorizes access to delete a database).</p>
<p><a href="#BM_%5Cb(IAM)%5Cb%2F">IAM</a> breaks down access control as policies. An <a href="#BM_(IAM%20policy%7CIAM%20policies)%2Fi">IAM policy</a> defines whether particular action can be performed of particular resource (e.g. if you can creating an <a href="#BM_%5Cb(instance%7CEC2%20instance)s%3F%5Cb%2F">EC2 instance</a>). That <a href="#BM_(IAM%20policy%7CIAM%20policies)%2Fi">IAM policy</a> can then be applied to a ...</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#BM_(IAM%20user)%2Fi">IAM user</a>, which is a user under the <a href="#BM_%5Cb(AWS)%5Cb%2F">AWS</a> account.</li>
<li><a href="#BM_(IAM%20group)%2Fi">IAM group</a>, which is a collection of <a href="#BM_(IAM%20user)%2Fi">IAM user</a>s (a <a href="#BM_(IAM%20user)%2Fi">IAM user</a> can be under multiple groups).</li>
<li><a href="#BM_(IAM%20role)%2Fi">IAM role</a>, which is a collection of policies to be assigned to other entities at some later point in time (e.g. service accounts, giving access to other <a href="#BM_%5Cb(AWS)%5Cb%2F">AWS</a> accounts, giving access to federated accounts / accounts outside of <a href="#BM_%5Cb(AWS)%5Cb%2F">AWS</a>, etc..).</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="svgbob_567f547b3f936dc4d02cb6bd3c4a41085ce55e62.svg" alt="Kroki diagram output"></p>
<p><a href="#BM_(IAM%20user)%2Fi">IAM user</a>s / <a href="#BM_(IAM%20group)%2Fi">IAM group</a>s / <a href="#BM_(IAM%20role)%2Fi">IAM role</a>s are forked off from the <a href="#BM_(root%20user)%2Fi">root user</a>, which is the user that gets created when the <a href="#BM_%5Cb(AWS)%5Cb%2F">AWS</a> account is created. Where as the default behavior for a <a href="#BM_(root%20user)%2Fi">root user</a> is to have unrestricted access to all services and resources under the <a href="#BM_%5Cb(AWS)%5Cb%2F">AWS</a> account, the default behavior for these forked off entities is to deny access. Policies can then be assigned to these entities to allow access to particular services and resources.</p>
<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">
<p><strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong></p>
<p>Standard practice is for the <a href="#BM_(root%20user)%2Fi">root user</a> to not make changes directly, but to create various <a href="#BM_(IAM%20user)%2Fi">IAM user</a>s / <a href="#BM_(IAM%20group)%2Fi">IAM group</a>s / <a href="#BM_(IAM%20role)%2Fi">IAM role</a>s, each limited to only the permissions necessary to do the tasks needed.</p>
</div>
<p><a href="#BM_(IAM%20user)%2Fi">IAM user</a>s may have multiple policies for a specific resource and action (e.g. an <a href="#BM_(IAM%20user)%2Fi">IAM user</a> could be both in <a href="#BM_(IAM%20group)%2Fi">IAM group</a> A and <a href="#BM_(IAM%20group)%2Fi">IAM group</a> B, both of which have a policy for reading an <a href="#BM_%5Cb(S3%20bucket)s%3F%5Cb%2F">S3 bucket</a>). Should any of those multiple policies be set to deny, the denial takes precedence.</p>
<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">
<p><strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong></p>
<p>One piece of <a href="#BM_%5Cb(AWS)%5Cb%2F">AWS</a> that's deeply related to this area is <a href="#BM_%5Cb(AWS)%5Cb%2F">AWS</a> <a href="#BM_(CloudTrail)%2Fi">CloudTrail</a>, which keeps an audit log of which users performed what access at what time.</p>

<li>
<p>Action: A service and verb, describing the action to be taken on that service</p>
<ul>

<li>This may be a full wildcard (targets everything): <code>*</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some resources don't have a <a href="#BM_(region)%2Fi">region</a> associated with them (e.g. the <a href="#BM_%5Cb(S3)%5Cb%2F">S3</a> example above), meaning that the <a href="#BM_%5Cb(ARN)s%3F%5Cb%2F">ARN</a> <a href="#BM_(region)%2Fi">region</a> field is left blank.

<p>Recall that when there are multiple policies for the same resource and action (e.g. an <a href="#BM_(IAM%20user)%2Fi">IAM user</a> could be both in <a href="#BM_(IAM%20group)%2Fi">IAM group</a> A and <a href="#BM_(IAM%20group)%2Fi">IAM group</a> B, both of which have a policy for reading an <a href="#BM_%5Cb(S3%20bucket)s%3F%5Cb%2F">S3 bucket</a>), denials always take precedence.</p>
<p><code>NotResource</code> and <code>NotAction</code> are commonly used with <code>Deny</code>.</p>
</div>
<p>Policies come in two varieties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Managed policies can be attached to multiple <a href="#BM_(IAM%20user)%2Fi">IAM user</a>s, <a href="#BM_(IAM%20group)%2Fi">IAM group</a>s, and / or <a href="#BM_(IAM%20role)%2Fi">IAM role</a>s. Each managed policy has its own <a href="#BM_%5Cb(ARN)s%3F%5Cb%2F">ARN</a>.</li>
<li>Inline policies are embedded into a single <a href="#BM_(IAM%20user)%2Fi">IAM user</a>, <a href="#BM_(IAM%20group)%2Fi">IAM group</a>, or <a href="#BM_(IAM%20role)%2Fi">IAM role</a>. An inline policy can't be attached to any identity other than the one its embedded in.</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">
<p><strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong></p>
<p>The learning material advises against inline policies. Instead, if says you can create a managed policy and set a condition on it such that it only applied when attached to the identity of interest: <code>"StringEquals": { "aws:username": "johndoe" }</code>.</p>

<p>A <a href="#BM_(network%20access%20control%20list)%2Fi">network access control list</a> (<a href="#BM_%5Cb(NACL)s%3F%5Cb%2F">NACL</a>) is a set rules that defines what traffic is allowed in to and out of one or more <a href="#BM_(subnet)%2Fi">subnet</a>. Each rule is defined by a record comprised of the following items:</p>
<ol>
<li>Number, which defines the rule's evaluation priority in the list of rules.</li>
<li>Type, which defines the type of traffic to look for (e.g. SSH).</li>
<li>Protocol, which defines the type of packet to look for (e.g. TCP or UDP)</li>
<li>Port range, which defines which ports to look for (e.g. 8080-8088)</li>
<li>Source IP <a href="#BM_%5Cb(CIDR%7CCIDR%20block)s%3F%5Cb%2F">CIDR</a> block, which defines which inbound IPs to look for.</li>

A <a href="#BM_%5Cb(NACL)s%3F%5Cb%2F">NACL</a> can be associated with multiple <a href="#BM_(subnet)%2Fi">subnet</a>s, but each <a href="#BM_(subnet)%2Fi">subnet</a> can be associated with at most one <a href="#BM_%5Cb(NACL)s%3F%5Cb%2F">NACL</a>.

<p>An <a href="#BM_(Internet%20gateway)%2Fi">Internet gateway</a> (<a href="#BM_%5Cb(IGW)s%3F%5Cb%2F">IGW</a>) is a bridge allowing resources in a <a href="#BM_%5Cb(VPC)s%3F%5Cb%2F">VPC</a> (e.g. <a href="#BM_%5Cb(instance%7CEC2%20instance)s%3F%5Cb%2F">EC2 instance</a>s) to communicate with the Internet, provided those resources have a <a href="#BM_(public)%2Fi">public</a> IPv4 or IPv6 address. <a href="#BM_%5Cb(IGW)s%3F%5Cb%2F">IGW</a>s apply to all <a href="#BM_(subnet)%2Fi">subnet</a>s of a <a href="#BM_%5Cb(VPC)s%3F%5Cb%2F">VPC</a>, so long as the <a href="#BM_(implicit%20router)%2Fi">implicit router</a> of those <a href="#BM_(subnet)%2Fi">subnet</a>s has a <a href="#BM_(route%20table%7Croute)%2Fi">route</a> for Internet traffic.</p>
<p>Since IPv6 addresses are globally unique, they are <a href="#BM_(public)%2Fi">public</a> by default.

To support outbound-only communication with the Internet (similar to how a <a href="#BM_%5Cb(NAT%20gateway%7CNAT)s%3F%5Cb%2F">NAT</a> works for IPv4), resources with IPv6 addresses may choose to use an <a href="#BM_(egress-only%20Internet%20gateway)%2Fi">egress-only internet gateway</a> (<a href="#BM_%5Cb(EIGW)s%3F%5Cb%2F">EIGW</a>) instead of an <a href="#BM_%5Cb(IGW)s%3F%5Cb%2F">IGW</a>.</p>

<p>The offer price for an <a href="#BM_(spot%20instance%7Cspot%20EC2%20instance%7CEC2%20spot%20instance)%2Fi">spot EC2 instance</a> is known as the spot price, which constantly fluctuates based on demand.

To guard against abrupt terminations, the buyer can purchase a spot block, which is a guaranteed block of time between 1 to 6 hours.</p>

<p>Encrypted volumes result in encrypted snapshots, and encrypted snapshots result in encrypted volumes. While you can't encrypt a volume after you've created it, what you can do is snapshot it, encrypt the snapshot, and then restore that snapshot.

<p>Likewise, an <a href="#BM_%5Cb(EBS%20volume%7CEBS)s%3F%5Cb%2F">EBS volume</a> is usable while restoring from a snapshot. If a block is accessed before it's been restored from the snapshot, the restoration process will prioritize to be retrieved it immediately, blocking until it's available.</p>
<p><a href="#BM_%5Cb(EBS%20volume%7CEBS)s%3F%5Cb%2F">EBS</a> snapshotting is incremental, meaning that subsequent snapshots only store changed blocks.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong></p>
<p><a href="#BM_%5Cb(NFS)s%3F%5Cb%2F">NFS</a> doesn't behave exactly the same as a local file system: Some Linux system calls (e.g. <code>flock()</code>) won't work on <a href="#BM_%5Cb(NFS)s%3F%5Cb%2F">NFS</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#BM_%5Cb(EFS)s%3F%5Cb%2F">EFS</a> volumes are categorized by storage class:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard: For actively used data.</li>
<li>Infrequent Access: For dormant data intended to be accessed a few times per quarter, providing lower cost but higher latency (access fee applied as well).</li>
<li>Archive: For formant data intended to be accessed a few times per year, providing lower cost but higher latency (access fee applied as well).</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#BM_%5Cb(EFS)s%3F%5Cb%2F">EFS</a> volumes are durable (data automatically replicated) and automatically scale storage capacity up/down as required. Data on <a href="#BM_%5Cb(EBS%20volume%7CEBS)s%3F%5Cb%2F">EBS volume</a>s are stored either ...</p>
<ul>
<li>within a single <a href="#BM_(region)%2Fi">region</a>, where availability and durability guarantees are for that <a href="#BM_(region)%2Fi">region</a>.</li>

</ul>
<p>The latter, referred to as <a href="#BM_%5Cb(EFS)s%3F%5Cb%2F">EFS</a> One Zone, is provided at lower cost due to a greater risk of outages. While both protect against drive failures, <a href="#BM_%5Cb(EFS)s%3F%5Cb%2F">EFS</a> One Zone will fail completely should the <a href="#BM_%5Cb(AZs%3F)%5Cb%2F">AZ</a> that it's operating in go down.</p>
<p><a href="#BM_%5Cb(EFS)s%3F%5Cb%2F">EFS</a> volumes have two performance classes:</p>
<ul>
<li>General Purpose mode: Supports normal data access patterns.</li>
<li>Max IO mode: Supports highly parallel data access patterns, but with higher latencies.</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">
<p><strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong></p>
<p>There are some restrictions here with <a href="#BM_%5Cb(EFS)s%3F%5Cb%2F">EFS</a> One Zone. The documentation right now recommends using General Purpose for everything.</p>
<p>I'm assuming these performance classes are only valid for the Standard storage class. It doesn't make sense otherwise. If you're using Infrequent Access or Archive, they're already severely gating how often you access data?</p>
</div>
<p><a href="#BM_%5Cb(EFS)s%3F%5Cb%2F">EFS</a> volumes have three throughput classes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elastic Throughput: Suited to workloads that are unpredictable or difficult to forecast.</li>
<li>Provisioned Throughput: Suited to workloads that are predictable, meaning the user sets the maximum throughput.</li>
<li>Bursting Throughput: Throughput scales with the amount of storage.</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">
<p><strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong></p>
<p>Like with <a href="#BM_%5Cb(EBS%20volume%7CEBS)s%3F%5Cb%2F">EBS volume</a>s, <a href="#BM_%5Cb(EFS)s%3F%5Cb%2F">EFS</a> volumes using a performance class other than Provisioned Throughput have a strange burst credit system, where credits build up over time and you can use them for short periods of faster read throughput.</p>
</div>
<p><a href="#BM_%5Cb(EFS)s%3F%5Cb%2F">EFS</a> requires network access to port 2049, meaning the <a href="#BM_(security%20group)%2Fi">security group</a> used by the <a href="#BM_%5Cb(instance%7CEC2%20instance)s%3F%5Cb%2F">EC2 instance</a>s may need to be updated. Once network access is allowed, an <a href="#BM_%5Cb(EFS)s%3F%5Cb%2F">EFS</a> volume may be mounted manually using a helper utility called <code>amazon-efs-utils</code>.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>sudo yum install -y amazon-efs-utils
sudo mkdir ./my-efs
sudo mount -t efs {efs-identifier}:/ ./my-efs

<p>The <code>amazon-efs-utils</code> helper utility streamlines the use of features specific to <a href="#BM_%5Cb(EFS)s%3F%5Cb%2F">EFS</a>, such as automatically handling encryption during transit.</p>
<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">
<p><strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong></p>
<p>Is updating <a href="#BM_(security%20group)%2Fi">security group</a>s a hard requirement or does <a href="#BM_%5Cb(AWS)%5Cb%2F">AWS</a> automatically handle this somehow? If so, are there other access control mechanisms in the <a href="#BM_%5Cb(VPC)s%3F%5Cb%2F">VPC</a> that need to updated as well? Maybe <a href="#BM_%5Cb(NACL)s%3F%5Cb%2F">NACL</a>?</p>
</div>
<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">
<p><strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong></p>
<p>It's advised that you use <code>amazon-efs-utils</code> to deal with <a href="#BM_%5Cb(EFS)s%3F%5Cb%2F">EFS</a>, but you aren't forced to use it. You can also use the standard <a href="#BM_%5Cb(NFS)s%3F%5Cb%2F">NFS</a> utilities that come with your Linux distro:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>sudo yum -y install nfs-utils
sudo mkdir ./my-efs

<p><strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong></p>
<p>Auto-mounting an <a href="#BM_%5Cb(EFS)s%3F%5Cb%2F">EFS</a> volume may be done by updated <code>/etc/fstab</code> to include the line <code>filesystem-id:/ mount-target efs default,_netdev 0 0</code>.

Each <a href="#BM_%5Cb(AMI)s%3F%5Cb%2F">AMI</a> typically contains an operating system (e.g. Ubuntu Linux or Windows), common software packages (e.g. grep, bash, etc..), and data / configurations. Most common <a href="#BM_%5Cb(AMI)s%3F%5Cb%2F">AMI</a>s are free to use, while others require a fee of some kind. For example, SAP providers various versions of their software packaged as <a href="#BM_%5Cb(AMI)s%3F%5Cb%2F">AMI</a>s, which they charge for.</p>
<p>Any <a href="#BM_%5Cb(AWS)%5Cb%2F">AWS</a> account can have its own set of <a href="#BM_%5Cb(AMI)s%3F%5Cb%2F">AMI</a>s, which may be <a href="#BM_(private%7Cinternal)%2Fi">private</a> or <a href="#BM_(public)%2Fi">public</a>ly-available. <a href="#BM_%5Cb(AMI)s%3F%5Cb%2F">AMI</a>s come in two flavors:</p>

<p>Linux-based <a href="#BM_%5Cb(instance%7CEC2%20instance)s%3F%5Cb%2F">EC2 instance</a>s can be connected to through a variety of mechanisms. Traditionally, the connection mechanism of choice has been SSH pre-configured with a <a href="#BM_(public)%2Fi">public</a>/<a href="#BM_(private%7Cinternal)%2Fi">private</a> keypair rather than password credentials. This mechanism requires at least some of your <a href="#BM_%5Cb(instance%7CEC2%20instance)s%3F%5Cb%2F">EC2 instance</a>s to be <a href="#BM_(public)%2Fi">public</a>ly exposed to (<a href="#BM_(public)%2Fi">public</a> IP address and open ports). However, newer connection mechanisms don't require <a href="#BM_(public)%2Fi">public</a> exposure.</p>

<p>SSH is the connection mechanism traditionally used to connect to an <a href="#BM_%5Cb(instance%7CEC2%20instance)s%3F%5Cb%2F">EC2 instance</a>. In it's simplest form, it requires that the <a href="#BM_%5Cb(instance%7CEC2%20instance)s%3F%5Cb%2F">EC2 instance</a> be created with a <a href="#BM_(public)%2Fi">public</a>/<a href="#BM_(private%7Cinternal)%2Fi">private</a> keypair, have a <a href="#BM_(public)%2Fi">public</a> IP address, and be assigned a <a href="#BM_(security%20group)%2Fi">security group</a> that allows listening on port 22 (SSH port).</p>

<p>A common pattern used to increase security is the use of <a href="#BM_(bastion%20host%7Cbastion%7Cjump%20box)%2Fi">bastion host</a>s: A <a href="#BM_(bastion%20host%7Cbastion%7Cjump%20box)%2Fi">bastion host</a> is a short-lived temporary <a href="#BM_%5Cb(instance%7CEC2%20instance)s%3F%5Cb%2F">EC2 instance</a> that's <a href="#BM_(public)%2Fi">public</a>ly accessible, responsible for acting as a bridge to <a href="#BM_%5Cb(instance%7CEC2%20instance)s%3F%5Cb%2F">EC2 instance</a>s that aren't <a href="#BM_(public)%2Fi">public</a>ly accessible. This way, <a href="#BM_%5Cb(instance%7CEC2%20instance)s%3F%5Cb%2F">EC2 instance</a>s running critical services don't need to be exposed to the <a href="#BM_(public)%2Fi">public</a> (no open ports on <a href="#BM_(public)%2Fi">public</a> IPs / no <a href="#BM_(public)%2Fi">public</a> IPs).

<ul>
<li>
<p>health / status checks, where <a href="#BM_%5Cb(instance%7CEC2%20instance)s%3F%5Cb%2F">EC2 instance</a>s are periodically queried to determine if they're overburdened, underburdened, or otherwise unhealthy. If it's determined that an <a href="#BM_%5Cb(instance%7CEC2%20instance)s%3F%5Cb%2F">EC2 instance</a> is ...</p>
<ul>
<li>overburdened, more <a href="#BM_%5Cb(instance%7CEC2%20instance)s%3F%5Cb%2F">instance</a>s are typically added.</li>
<li>underburdened, existing <a href="#BM_%5Cb(instance%7CEC2%20instance)s%3F%5Cb%2F">instance</a>s are typically terminated.</li>
<li>unhealthy, the <a href="#BM_%5Cb(instance%7CEC2%20instance)s%3F%5Cb%2F">instance</a> is replaced.</li>
</ul>
<p>What constitutes overburdened or underburdened is defined by the user and scaling policy (discussed further below), potentially  based on a metrics collection service built-in to <a href="#BM_%5Cb(AWS)%5Cb%2F">AWS</a> called <a href="#BM_(CloudWatch)%2Fi">CloudWatch</a>.

<p>In <a href="#BM_(CloudWatch)%2Fi">CloudWatch</a>, it may be best to enable "detailed" <a href="#BM_(CloudWatch)%2Fi">cloudwatch</a> monitoring. This way you get per-minute stats instead of per-5min stats.</p>

<li>Manual scaling: The number of <a href="#BM_%5Cb(instance%7CEC2%20instance)s%3F%5Cb%2F">EC2 instance</a>s is set directly by the user.</li>
<li>Dynamic scaling: The number of <a href="#BM_%5Cb(instance%7CEC2%20instance)s%3F%5Cb%2F">EC2 instance</a>s changes based on metrics such as CPU usage (requires <a href="#BM_(CloudWatch)%2Fi">CloudWatch</a>).</li>
<li>Scheduled scaling: The number of <a href="#BM_%5Cb(instance%7CEC2%20instance)s%3F%5Cb%2F">EC2 instance</a>s changes based on a time schedule (e.g. scale down number of <a href="#BM_%5Cb(instance%7CEC2%20instance)s%3F%5Cb%2F">instance</a>s on Mondays and Wednesdays after 5pm).</li>
<li>Predictive scaling: The number of <a href="#BM_%5Cb(instance%7CEC2%20instance)s%3F%5Cb%2F">EC2 instance</a>s changed based on past historical load, similar to scheduled scaling but schedules are captures automatically.</li>

<p>The proximity of a set of <a href="#BM_%5Cb(instance%7CEC2%20instance)s%3F%5Cb%2F">EC2 instance</a>s can be influenced using placement groups. A placement group can either place those <a href="#BM_%5Cb(instance%7CEC2%20instance)s%3F%5Cb%2F">EC2 instance</a>s ...</p>
<ul>
<li>close together, useful for workloads that require tight networking performance.</li>

<li>Infrequent Access One Zone: For less frequent data access, but limited to a single <a href="#BM_%5Cb(AZs%3F)%5Cb%2F">AZ</a>.</li>
<li>Glacier Instant Retrieval: For long-lived storage where target data access interval is once per quarter but data access is still immediate.</li>
<li>Glacier Flexible Retrieval: For long-lived storage where target data access interval is 1-2 time per year, where data needs to be "rehydrated" over many minutes/hours to be accessed (you select how long it takes).</li>
<li>Glacier Deep Archive: For long-lived storage where target data access interval is 1-2 time per year, where data needs to be "rehydrated" over many hours to be accessed (up to 12 hours).</li>
<li>Intelligent-Tiering: For unknown data access patterns, where <a href="#BM_%5Cb(S3%20object)s%3F%5Cb%2F">S3 object</a>s are automatically moved between classes to better optimize costs.</li>

<p>Subscribers can filter <a href="#BM_%5Cb(SNS)%5Cb%2F">SNS</a> messages by setting filter policies that test attributes for certain conditions: value equality, suffix match, prefix match, numerical range testing, etc... The attribute conditions may be chained together using AND and OR. For example, consider <a href="#BM_%5Cb(SNS)%5Cb%2F">SNS</a> messages that come with a numeric attribute called price. An <a href="#BM_%5Cb(SNS)%5Cb%2F">SNS</a> subscription filter policy could filter out all messages whose with a price attribute below 10 and above 100.</p>
<p><a href="#BM_%5Cb(SNS)%5Cb%2F">SNS</a> heavily integrates with other <a href="#BM_%5Cb(AWS)%5Cb%2F">AWS</a> services. Integrations come in two forms:</p>
<ul>

<p>While standard queues have usage patterns similar to other distributed queues, FIFO queues are slightly differently. FIFO queues guarantee exact ordering for messages within the same group. Each message must have a group ID associated with it. When the queue is pulled from, messages from multiple different group IDs may be returned, but those within the same group ID are guaranteed to be in-order.</p>
<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">
<p><strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong></p>
<p>As of today, the throughput limit on FIFO queues is 3k messages-per-second with batching or 0.3k messages-per-second without batching. This can be increased to 70k messages-per-second with batching.</p>
</div>
<p>Messages are pulled from an <a href="#BM_%5Cb(SQS)%5Cb%2F">SQS</a> queue using polling. <a href="#BM_%5Cb(SQS)%5Cb%2F">SQS</a> supports two types of polling:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short polling: Messages pulled from a subset of shard, returning immediately if no messages are available on those shards.</li>
<li>Long polling: Message pulled from all shards, waiting until at least one message is available before returning (up to a certain duration).</li>
</ul>
<p>Since <a href="#BM_%5Cb(SQS)%5Cb%2F">SQS</a> messages are distributed / replicated across server shards, short polling may miss some messages. But, those missed messages will likely be returned in subsequent polls as the shards accessed will likely be different.</p>
<p>Pulling messages is a two-step process: Once the message is received by a poller, it goes into an invisible state where other pollers can't receive it (the message isn't deleted). The message stays in that invisible state for a certain duration of time before being made visible again. The point is for the poller who originally received the message to process that message and then explicitly delete it from the queue, ensuring that the message is still available for processing should the poller encounter an error during its processing (e.g. crash). Should the same message be polled multiple times without being deleted, <a href="#BM_%5Cb(SQS)%5Cb%2F">SQS</a> will move into a special queue for unprocessable messages called a dead-letter queue.</p>

<p><a href="#BM_(Lambda)%2Fi">Lambda</a> is a <a href="#BM_(serverless)%2Fi">serverless</a> service that runs code in response to an event. The code, referred to as a function, takes the event as input and processes it in some way (e.g. stores it in a database, sends out an email, etc..).</p>
<p>The function itself may be written in any modern language, but must be packaged as a zip file or a container image. If packaged as a ...</p>
<ul>

<p>If using a zip, one common pattern is to include dependencies within the zip via <code>pip install -r requirements.txt -t .</code> which install the packages into the current directory rather than the Python installation. Another common examples is to use "<a href="#BM_(Lambda)%2Fi">Lambda</a> layers", which is another zip file that can be shared across various function zips and contains supplementary data like dependencies</p>
<p>If you have dependencies or custom runtimes, using containers may be a better idea.</p>

<p>Depending on what triggered the service, a function may be invoked synchronously or asynchronously. Invocations that are ...</p>
<ul>
<li>synchronous expect a result, meaning the invoker waits for the function to finish execution. Retry logic is handled by the caller.</li>
<li>asynchronous don't expect a result, meaning the invoker queues up the invocation and forgets about it.

</ul>
<p>As an example, invocations by <a href="#BM_(API%20Gateway)%2Fi">API Gateway</a> are synchronous (e.g. it expects a response to send back to the HTTP call) while invocations by <a href="#BM_(CloudWatch)%2Fi">CloudWatch</a> alarms are asynchronous.

<p><strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong></p>
<p>Supported web API protocols include REST, HTTP, and WebSocket. This section primarily deals with REST / HTTP.</p>
</div>
<p>Each combination of API path (resources) and HTTP method can be bound to a different computing service, typically referred to as an integration. For example, an HTTP <code>GET</code> on the path <code>/my_resource</code> may direct the request to integrate with a <a href="#BM_(Lambda)%2Fi">Lambda</a> function for processing, while an HTTP <code>POST</code> on the same path may direct the request to integrate with <a href="#BM_%5Cb(ECS)s%3F%5Cb%2F">ECS</a>.</p>

<li>Versioning: Launch several versions of an API in tandem (e.g. v1, v2, v3, etc..).</li>
<li>Staging: Launch several versions of an API in tandem (e.g. dev, prod, etc..).</li>
<li>Track usage: Collect metrics on per-user API usage.</li>

<p>Batch is a service for running each item in a set of data, referred to as a batch, over the same computation. Computations are packaged as container images, where Batch schedules and executes those container images over the set of data. The compute resources used to execute the container images are typically provisioned and managed by Batch, but may also be managed directly by the user (e.g. you provide your own <a href="#BM_%5Cb(EC2)%5Cb%2F">EC2</a> or <a href="#BM_%5Cb(ECS)s%3F%5Cb%2F">ECS</a> cluster).</p>
<p>Batch organizes workloads into the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Job - A task to be executed. Each job may be a ...</p>
<ul>
<li>single job, which is a single task to be executed.</li>
<li>array job, which is a set of child tasks to be executed in parallel.</li>

<p>Each job may have dependencies to other jobs, a failure timeout (expected time to finish before forcing a failure), and automated retries on failure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Job definition - A definition for a how a job is to be run, consisting of ...</p>
<ul>
<li>resource requirements (e.g. CPU, memory, storage mounts, etc..).</li>
<li>permissions (e.g. <a href="#BM_(IAM%20role)%2Fi">IAM role</a>s).</li>

</ul>
<p>When you submit a job, you specify the job definition it should use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Job queues - A queue of jobs pending execution. There may be multiple queues within Batch.</p>

<li>
<p>Compute environment - Compute resources used to run jobs.
