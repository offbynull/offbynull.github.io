<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">

<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

The `class` in `friend class` may be omitted if `MyFriend` was already declared before `MyClass`. Adding the word `class` is a forward declaration -- it tells the compiler to just believe that it exists even though it may not have come across it yet.
