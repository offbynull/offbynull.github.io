<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">

<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

There are also functions that are a combination of various functions above: `std::transform_reduce()`, `std::transform_inclusive_scan()`, and `std::transform_exclusive_scan()`.

`std::inner_product()` is like `std::transform_reduce()` except it guarantees the operation goe from left-to-right (left-fold).
