<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">

<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

Testing on godbolt, the proxy functor generated by `std::bind` requires *at least* as many parameters as the maximum placeholder value. So for example, if you only used `std::placeholders::_1` and `std::placeholders::_5`, the proxy functor still requires that you supply something for 2nd, 3rd, and 4th parameters of the proxy functor even though they aren't mapped to anything. You can also supply arguments for a 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, ... parameter, even though they aren't mapped using `std::placeholder`s, and it'll be fine. You just can't supply less than 5.
