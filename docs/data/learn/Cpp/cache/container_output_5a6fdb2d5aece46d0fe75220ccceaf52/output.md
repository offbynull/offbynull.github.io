You probably shouldn't do this because it gets confusing. Also, incrementing/decrementing the same variable more than once in the same expression isn't defined behaviour: The order of  incrementing/decrementing can change based on whatever the compiler thinks is best, meaning that the results won't be consistent across different platforms / compilers / compiler options / etc...
