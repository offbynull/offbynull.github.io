<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

The original intent of `inline` was to indicate to the compiler that embedding a copy of the function for an invocation was preferred over an function call. The reason being that is certain cases the code would be faster if it were embedded rather than having it branch into a function call.
