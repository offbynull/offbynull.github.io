Don't depend on this to sort alphabetically because it isn't portable. Lexicographically doesn't mean alphabetical, it just means that it compares by the symbol (character in this case). The comparisons depend on the encoding of the string. According to the book, for US-ASCII (most common), it means `A < Z < a < z`.
