<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

`std::search()` in particular seems to have overloads for different kinds of "searchers": `default_searcher`, `boyer_moore_searcher`, `boyer_moore_horspool_searcher`, and possibly others maybe provided by other libraries (e.g. boost). I don't know enough about this to know what the benefit of using one over the other is.
