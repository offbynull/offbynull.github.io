<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

Remember that `sizeof` is a unary operator, similar to how the negative sign is a unary operator that negates whatever is to the right of it. People usually structure its usage in code as if it were a function (e.g. `sizeof(x)` vs `sizeof x`). This sometimes causes confusion for people coming from other languages.
