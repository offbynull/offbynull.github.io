<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

I see online that `FLT_DIG`, `DBL_DIG`, `LDBL_DIG`, and `DECIMAL_DIG` define the number of "decimal digits" that can be converted to floating point and back without a loss in precision. I'm assuming that just means the max number of digits that can be represented in a float where exp is 1?
