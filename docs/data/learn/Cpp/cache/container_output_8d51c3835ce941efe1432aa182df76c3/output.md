<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">

<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

This is only for non-members (not belonging to a class).

The meaning of `static` changes when the function or variables belongs to a class (method). When applied on a member function, it means that it isn't bound to any instance of the class -- it can't access fields belonging to an instance.
