<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

The closest Java analog I could think of is the base class hierarchy where all Java objects have to derive from `java.lang.Object`. You can accept a type of `Java.lang.Object` and cast it at runtime to the correct type (or one of its ancestors). The C++ any class provides similar functionality to that.
