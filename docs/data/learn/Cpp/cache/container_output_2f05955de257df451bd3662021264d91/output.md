<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

CMake isn't a build system itself, but a tool that generates the configuration needed for build systems. The idea is that, since C++ code can be compiled on many different platforms and build systems, this high-level tool can be used to generate the configuration for those build systems. For example, building on Linux is commonly done using Make while on Windows it's commonly done through Microsoft Visual Studio IDE project files. CMake can configure both using the same CMake script.
