<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

What about other character types (e.g. `char8_t`)? Not supported because encoding support in C++ is not really there as of C++20. So what encoding is used here? Platform-specific maybe? or ASCII? It's probably stated somewhere but I have yet to find out what it is. On most major platforms, it's probably safe to assume that basic printable ASCII characters are there encoded as they would be in ASCII.
