<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

This code above makes use of the type traits library in the C++ standard libraries. Type traits are templates that provide information about types (e.g if a type is signed or unsigned, if it has a copy constructor, etc...). The link below jumps to that section. It's safe to read at this point as it doesn't require any background knowledge other than how to make use of templates, which is something you should already be aware of at this point.
