<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

Recall that ...

* vscode will automatically reconfigure CMake on any change to the configuration file.
* vscode will build your code when you hit F7.

Conan changes ARE NOT automatically picked up. You need to re-run conan (from `./build` -- see the cookie cutter template post hook) to pick up any library changes.
