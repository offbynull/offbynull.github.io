<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

In the subsections below, the function overloads without execution policy are the ones listed. This is because not all functions provide execution policy overloads.

The required iterator types aren't listed either because they aren't consistent between function overloads. Almost all overloads will work properly on `std::vector`.
