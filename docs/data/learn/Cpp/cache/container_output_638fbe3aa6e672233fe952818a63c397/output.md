<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

There's a version of weak pointer in Boost and one in the C++ standard library. The Boost version is legacy. Each weak pointer version is tied to the shared pointer from its library. For example, if you're using the weak pointer in Boost, you need to use it with the shared pointer from Boost.
