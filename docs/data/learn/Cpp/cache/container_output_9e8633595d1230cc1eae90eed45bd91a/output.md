<div style="margin:2em; background-color: #e0e0e0;">

<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

The book mentions the comma operator specifically. It doesn't look this is used for much and the book recommends against using it for anything (e.g. operator overloading) due to the confusion it causes. This gives off similar vibes to Python's tuple syntax, where you can pass an unenclosed tuple as a subscript to something. When I was learning Python, that also came off as very confusing.

```python
x = obj['column name', 100]
```
</div>
