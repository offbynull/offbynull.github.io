From the book:

> Each time a template is instantiated, the compiler must be able to generate all the code necessary to use the template. This means all the information about how to instantiate a custom class or function must be available within the same translation unit as the template instantiation. By far, the most popular way to achieve this is to implement templates entirely within header files.
