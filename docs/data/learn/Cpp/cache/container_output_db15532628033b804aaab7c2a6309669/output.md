<strong>⚠️NOTE️️️⚠️</strong>

There is no equivalent or overloads for string specializations like `std::u8string`? How is someone supposed to convert those? The answer seems to be to use a third-party library (ICU might provide some functionality for this). It seems as if the C++20 standard still doesn't have full support for text encoding. Third-party libraries are required.
